            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I ſay, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied here with, it put me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bringing his conſtituent Principles of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> to the Teſt; and to make a further ſcrutiny into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ingredients of that Spring, that upon more throughly made experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:41152:3"/>I might the better be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, whether I was in an error or no; or whether indeed, thoſe five <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ingredients,</hi> that Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> had aſcribed to that <hi>Spaw,</hi> were the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Principles</hi> thereof: To which purpoſe I made ſome <hi>Animadverſions</hi> upon his depoſited <hi>Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt ſheets whereof, I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome ingenuous acquaintance of mine, (who longed to ſee ſome Experimental Trial of the <hi>Minerals</hi> of this <hi>Spring</hi>) with which they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be taken, and gave me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to go on, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat (if I could) what I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. Thoſe few firſt ſheets I let lie <hi>dormant</hi> by me all the Winter; in the Spring I revived them, and ſet down ſome <hi>Experiments</hi> I had made the laſt Summer; alſo I made ſome freſh <hi>Experiments</hi> of the <hi>Mineral Earth,</hi> found upon the Bank near the <hi>Spaw, &amp;c.</hi> and after I had finiſhed
<pb facs="tcp:41152:3"/>the diſcourſe of the <hi>Mineral Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients</hi> thereof, I ſaw a neceſſity of treating of Diſeaſes; <hi>(viz.)</hi> which were curable by the <hi>Spaw,</hi> which not: and what obſervations I have made therein, whether they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant or not to truth, and the late diſcoveries made, by the <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Practice</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> is left to thee (Judicious Reader) to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. I confeſs, I have not been ſo large in my diſcourſe of Diſeaſes as I might have been, or as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that nature did require, not intending to ſwell this peice into a large volume; nor indeed was I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (at preſent) to put down all my <hi>Obſervations</hi> thereon, reſerving many of them to another ſeaſonable opportunity, as occaſion ſhall offer and theſe find acceptance. I have, I confeſs, in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> made ſome large digreſſions, and have not wound my ſelf back again by ſo uniform
<pb facs="tcp:41152:4"/>a clew, as I could have wiſh'd: And indeed upon a review I eſpie ſome diſcernable flaws, and chinks in the junctures thereof; which are now too late to amend, nor could it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, unleſs it were by taking ſome parts thereof in peices, and cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them afreſh, which now cannot be done: yet they are ſuch as a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eye will not eaſily diſcover. As to that digreſſion, of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Philoſophy by a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Character, it was (I confeſs) done before I had ſeen any thing of Dr. <hi>Wilkins</hi>'s Book to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; who certainly hath deſign'd ſuch a clear Methodical draught thereof, as that without doubt, he hath outdone all that ever we heard of, that went before him: Which if it take, and get footing in the world, will (without a peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) prove the moſt facil direct road, to the improvement of the
<pb facs="tcp:41152:4"/>natural parts of man, in the true outward <hi>Scientifical</hi> knowledge of things, by this Univerſal Character. For by this invention, Children (and others) will be train'd up, not in the knowledg of letters, or words alone; but in the true <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſtical</hi> knowledge of things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, according to their moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diſtinguiſhable. <hi>Signatures:</hi> which if it take, will ſave poſterity a great deal of time, which we have with little fruit ſpent at the Schools.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Appendix</hi> concerning the Original of Springs, when I ſent my papers to the preſs, I had then no thoughts to have diſcours'd thereof at this impreſſion; but finding that I had an opportunity given by the neceſſary delayes of the Preſs (taking more time to do it in, than I at firſt expected) I ſet upon it: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too late to be inſerted in its right place, <hi>viz.</hi> immediately before the
<pb facs="tcp:41152:5"/>diſcourſe of Hot-Springs, the Preſs being gone beyond that part, was fore'd to bring it in as an <hi>Appendix</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which are annexed other little additions, which before were omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and therefore refer to the Page, and line of the book, where they ſhould follow. As to our <hi>Ternary</hi> of Medicines, which anſwer the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Indications in Phyſick, for the cure of moſt Diſeaſes; as alſo our <hi>Epilogue,</hi> of the Eſſence of <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough Spaw,</hi> I ſhall refer what I have ſaid therein, to matter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment it ſelf. If any reflections have happen'd, they are more then I wiſh had been, but I hope, they will not be found immodeſt; for he that writes concerns of this nature, had need lay a good foundation of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, ſo that being thereby back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as I may ſay) or ſtrengthned, he need not much fear the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſaults of others. And in as much as
<pb facs="tcp:41152:5"/>it is truth evinced by matter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, that I contend for, therein I find ſatisfaction, in what I have done; and truly I have meted no other meaſure than I would expect in caſe any Writings of mine ſhould be found as equally naked and fenceleſs, and conſequently as expoſable to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Criticiſms: For any other hath the liberty of diſproving what I have wrote, and that by good reaſon too, ſo he do it fairly, by more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable matter of <hi>Experiment.</hi> The ſame liberty hath Dr. <hi>Wittie,</hi> if he pleaſe but to grant himſelf it, in vindication of what he hath Wrote; yea, and in defence of his <hi>Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Art</hi> too. As to this <hi>Chymical Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> of whoſe vindication I have ſuccinctly wrote, many <hi>Phyſicians</hi> now at this time (and more and more daily) do make it their way of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrating help to the Sick; ſo that (doubtleſs) in a little time, it will gain
<pb facs="tcp:41152:6"/>much ground, upon the World, and will at length naturally worm out the <hi>Galenical</hi> Method. For an active plodding <hi>Genius</hi> is now at work, which is bringing all former recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved opinions to the Teſt, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines them by matter of Fact, in <hi>Experiments;</hi> and what is found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to <hi>Truth,</hi> made forth by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral <hi>Obſervations,</hi> is approved, the reſt (as frivolous and uncertain) is rejected. And as to what I have propounded, in order to the raiſing a Structure of <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> by the Collection of <hi>Experiments</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though it may ſeem to be but an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian Product,</hi> better diſcourſed of then performed; yet may it probably, and not unaptly, be looked upon as a direct, even Road, toward a real <hi>Science</hi> of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Phyſiology:</hi> to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and perfecting of which, the <hi>Pyrotechnical Art</hi> is of no ſmall uſe,
<pb facs="tcp:41152:6"/>by <hi>Anatomizing</hi> and taking in pieces the Bodies of <hi>Concretes;</hi> thereby not only viewing their primitive conſtituent <hi>Principles,</hi> but alſo the great variety of new <hi>Products,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting therefrom, by the mediation of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Ferments:</hi> ſo that no ſmall inſight is got hereby, into the hidden <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which is ſeen to diſplay her ſelf wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the great variety of <hi>Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in the <hi>Mundane Syſtem,</hi> amongſt which, the Medicinal <hi>Concretes,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Vegetable, Animal</hi> or <hi>Mineral,</hi> are not of the leaſt concern.

The laſt of which (I find) he hath much borrowed out of <hi>Iſaac Holland,</hi> and probably had the knowledge of the reſt, from ſome <hi>Arabian</hi> Philoſophers themſelves, or their Books; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them was the <hi>Liquor Alkaheſt</hi> moſt known: which was the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> by which, moſt of his Mineral and Metalline <hi>Arcana's</hi> were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; as his Preparation of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> his <hi>Tinctura Lilii,</hi> his <hi>Sulphur Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris, &amp;c.</hi> yea, and of Vegetables too, witneſs his Preparation of the true <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> which was (as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith) made by the help of the <hi>Alkaheſt;</hi> and ſo Prepared, did cure the <hi>Aſthma, Epilepſie, Apoplexie, Palſie, Atrophy, Tabes, &amp;c.</hi> And as for <hi>Helmont,</hi> he goes ſo far out of the road of vulgar Chymiſts, as that he ſcarce gives any <hi>Recipes;</hi> what he gives is <hi>Sparſim,</hi> and wrapt up oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally
<pb facs="tcp:41152:9"/>amongſt his Writings, without any formal Proceſſes; his beſt <hi>Arcana's</hi> are but darkly ſet down, his choice Preparations are only curſorily inſerted, and the very <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of his <hi>Grand Solvent,</hi> but barely hinted: ſo that a Phyſician (if he expect any help by him) ought to read him often, and to compare his Writings, and thereby he will find no ſmall Light to guide him in his <hi>Chymical</hi> Reſearches. And though <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> be accus'd, for defacing the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical Structure</hi> of <hi>Phyſick;</hi> and not ſetting up a better in its place, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as it were) a <hi>Chymical Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory:</hi> yet he is not much to be blam'd herein, if we conſider, firſt, That he not only pulls down the <hi>Galenical Theory,</hi> but rears up a better, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Diſeaſes may the better be known, from their Eſſential Cauſes, and by their natural <hi>Symptoms</hi> and <hi>Products;</hi> but alſo gives conſiderable hints of
<pb facs="tcp:41152:9"/>more noble <hi>Preparations,</hi> whereby Diſeaſes may probably be Cured, much more effectually than by the common <hi>Methodical Practice</hi> of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick;</hi> for it would have been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no leſs then Imprudence in him, to have communicated to the World, the proceſs of (ſuppoſe) the <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> in a few lines plainly, and that in a quarter of an hour, which had coſt him the Pains and Study of moſt part of Thirty Years: This would have made ingenuous Perſons idle, by putting that into their hands of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, which ſhould have been the reſult of many Years Tryals. But he (like a Philoſopher) acteth more wiſely, obſcures his expreſſions, and vails his hints to ſuch noble <hi>Arcana's,</hi> thereby inciting Ingenuity putting an edge and vigour on the, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſatiated, and therefore dull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to further attainments. Beſides, ſuch foreſtalling of Ingenuity, would
<pb facs="tcp:41152:10"/>prevent the Invention of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate <hi>Menſtruums</hi> and curious <hi>Preparations,</hi> that might be, and are occaſionally found out, by ſearch, and unwearied <hi>Tryals.</hi> Therefore our profound Author is not at all to be diſliked, that he hath not reduced his Medicinal <hi>Arcana's</hi> into a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical Diſpenſatory.</hi> It's enough that he hath given us ſuch fair hints, which may be ſufficient ſpurs to our Ingenuity, to ſet us to work; that when we find out any thing of real worth, by our own induſtry, we ſhall be able to put a value thereon.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, No flattering <hi>Encomiaſticks</hi> ſhall uſher in this work, nor <hi>pedantick Rapſodiſts</hi> attend theſe lines; nor need we <hi>Caſta Napaearum,</hi> to adorn our <hi>Water-Nymphs;</hi> nor let the Reader expect our contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon our <hi>Water-Works;</hi> nor yet any <hi>Chronogram</hi> or <hi>Anagram</hi> to ſound abroad our fame; nor ſhall we court

                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41152:12"/>2. He tells us of five Ingredients of which this water partakes, and hath its Virtues from, which are the Conſtitutive principles of this Spring as he ſuppoſeth, and thoſe are, Vitriol, Iron, Allom, Nitre, and Salt; with theſe he currently paſſeth along through his book, where he hath occaſion to eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the Virtues of the Well, and make all the five <hi>Volens nolens,</hi> contribute to this Spring.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Firſt, as for Vitriol, the Doctor might have diſtinguiſhed whether he underſtood it to be <hi>Vitride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum martis,</hi> or <hi>veneris, viz.</hi> the Vitrio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Iron or of Copper; for if it be of Iron, then is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>viz.</hi> Iron Superfluous, becauſe the Iron would be the Metalline part of the Vitriol, in as much as every Vitriol is made of an Eſſurine Salt, diſſolv'd in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal veins of a Spring, which paſſing along the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera of a Metal, doth <hi>lambere venam,</hi> licks upon that Vein of Metal, whether Iron or Copper, which it partly diſſolves into it ſelf, and carries it (as I may ſay, in its belly to the viſible appearance of a Spring; which evaporated, gives a Vitriol, either of Iron or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, according as the Metal was that it paſſed through.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But if the Vitriol in <hi>Scarbrough Spaw</hi> be of Copper, then would the operation of the water be moſt what Emetick, or Vomitive, becauſe the body of Copper being diſſolv'd by an Eſſurine liquor (ſave that of the <hi>primum ens Salium,</hi> or liquor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaheſt of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi>) becomes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately Emetick, and can but with very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, by the Chymical Art, be ſeparated from that Eſſurine Salt, which hath coagulated it ſelf thereon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Again, If it was ſuch a Vitriol, the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of Iron, would by their mutual imbraces be ting'd, and almoſt tranſmuted into Copper, which I have found by a ſtrong decoction of Iron in Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olin
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41152:12"/>Water; but to omit that, Let us ſuppoſe that there were a Vitriol of <hi>Venus</hi> diſſolved in this Spring, and in ſo ſmall a proportion, as being mixed in a great quantity of water, <hi>viz.</hi> of 3 or 4 Quarts, which is the quantity Patients frequently drink, as not to work frequently by Vomit, but moſt what by Stool; and that the Purgatives property was from the mixture of this Vitriol and other Ingredients, named by the Doctor.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This being granted in favour of his Ingredients or Mineral Principles; then let us ſee what will be the ſequel, <hi>viz.</hi> whether or no, we may not lay by as uſeleſs, one of his Principles I am now diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of, <hi>viz.</hi> Iron, as an impertinent and inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ingredient, I mean, as to the body of it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For if the Eſſurine ſalt diſſolved in the Water-Spring, meet with a Vein of Copper in the bowels of the Earth (which Eſſurine Salt is always requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the making a Vitriol, of what ſort ſoever) fretting thereon diſſolves it, and at the ſame time that acidity is coagulated upon the metalline diſſolv'd parts <hi>[ſolutio &amp; coagulatio fiunt unico inſtanti; una edeamque res ſolvit ac à ſolventi coagulatur]</hi> and ſo both together become diſſolv'd in the ſolitary Spring Water, in an almoſt indiſſolvable nexure; then, and not till then, is the action of that Eſſurine acidity terminated, ſo as it can act no more; and though it ſhould, in the ſecret meanders of the Earth in its incircling perambulation, meet with a Vein of Iron, yet could it take nothing thence, becauſe it had already loſt its ſting, I mean, its fretting Salt had ſatiated it ſelf in <hi>coro metallico,</hi> in the embraces of an already eſpouſed Metal.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Mars</hi> cannot be diſſolv'd and appear in the form of a liquor, without a diſſolvent; but this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41152:13"/>diſſolvent, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eſſurine acidity, being already ſatiated and turned into a Vitriol, to make up one of Dr. <hi>Witties</hi> precanious Principles, is not at leiſure to make another of them, unleſs we grant ſuch an indulgence to Nature, which ſhe never was yet ſo kind to her ſelf as to take, I mean to diſſolve Mineral or Metalline Body, without an agent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. So that indeed we find a flaw in the main Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Building; an inconſiſtency of two of his chief Principles of this Mineral Water, Vitriol and Iron; that which makes the one, diſannuls the other; ſo that certainly they are not of the Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this <hi>Spaw,</hi> however we come to find them thus thruſt in by head and ſhoulders.</p>

THe Doctor undertakes to diſcourſe of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, and firſt he gives us an account of the ſeveral ſorts, not ſuch as he had ſeen, but ſuch as he ſaith (<hi>Sect.</hi> 12.) late Writers name, <hi>viz.</hi> three ſorts <hi>viz.

                  <p n="2">2. To me all natural Vitriols ſeem to be reducible indeed to three, <hi>viz.</hi> to that of Iron, Copper, and <hi>Vitriolum album;</hi> that of Copper admits of great variety according to the degrees of plenty and purity of the Eſſurine Salt, which is <hi>(Sulphuris em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brionati partus innaturus)</hi> an unripe birth of a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur <hi>in fieri;</hi> being far removed (as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith) from a Metallick nature, and nearer to the <hi>primum ens,</hi> which indeed gives the medicinal virtue to Vitriols; I ſay, according as Mineral Vitriols or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick Solutions, are enriched more or leſs with this Eſſurine Salt, <hi>propria ſponte illi innatum,</hi> ſo are they reckoned to be better or worſe, as to Medicinal uſe. The beſt of which are accounted the <hi>Cyprian, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian,</hi> or <hi>Goſlarick,</hi> or <hi>Dane</hi> Vitriol, being pretty well ſaturate, with plenty of this Eſſurine acidity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Natural Vitriols I ſaid, becauſe many artificial ſorts may be made; among which <hi>Roman</hi> Vitriol, and

                     <hi>viride eris</hi> may be numbred; which laſt being criſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd by Solution, Filtration and Evaporation, may be brought to fine Criſtals by the addition of Allom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may much reſemble the <hi>Roman</hi> Vitriol.</p>

                  <p>FIrſt, He is pleaſed to reckon up four ways, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Water may imbibe the nature and virtue of a Mineral or Metal.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By receiving its Vapour; his inſtance is, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtanding ſomewhile in a braſs or iron Kettle; will taſte of the braſs or iron: to which I ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That no metallick body, as ſuch, doth or can give a Vapour to a ſimple elementary Water, as long as the Water is homogeneal in its parts. Minerals indeed, being Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in <hi>ſolutis principiis,</hi> may, whilſt ſuch, give an dour (for ſo I had rather, and think more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call it, than a Vapour) to Elementary Water; as for inſtance, Antimony and its Preparations, <hi>viz.</hi> either the <hi>crocus metallorum</hi> or reguline part, can give an emitick property to Water or Wine.</p>
                  <p>So natural Vitriols, which are but their Metals <hi>in fieri,</hi> or <hi>in primo ente reſerato,</hi> can communicate the like emetick odour (though indeed there is ſome ſmall Solution) in Water.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But take the complete perfect Metals of theſe Minerals, and we ſhall find them ſuch compact bodies, as they have no Vapours, nay ſcarce any odour, to any ſimple Elementary Water; for inſtance, take Lead, which is the Metal of its Mineral Antimony, being the complete Metalline Body of that Mineral, boyl Water <hi>ad aevum</hi> in it, ſo as it be ſimple Water, and hath not undergone the leaſt degree of putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for then begins an analytical reſolution, ſet a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41152:14"/>work from a ſpurious acidity) and you ſhall find the Water to have contracted no ſaturnine impreſſion at all; but if the leaſt acioity either from the Air, or admixture of any acid liquor whatever, impregnate this Water, it ſhall make a Solution of the Metal, and turn it ſelf ſweet, more or leſs; according to the degree of the ſharpneſs of that acidity, till at laſt it come to a <hi>Saccharum Saturm,</hi> or Sugar of Lead.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame manner, the perfect Metals (perfect I mean <hi>in ſpecie</hi>) of Iron or Copper, being by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fuſions brought to their higheſt degree of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallin compaction, do no longer give any ſolution of parts, odour, or vapour to ſimple Water, as they did whilſt <hi>in principiis ſolutis,</hi> viz. in their Minerals or Vitriols; the which, daily experience evinceth. Do we not frequently boyl our Water for Broth, and moſt of our potable Liquors, in Iron, Copper or Braſs Veſſels, and that without the leaſt taſte of any of the Metals? which Metalline Veſſels as ſuch, may, though made of Silver or Gold, give no more vertue, ſapour or vapour, than the Metals of Glaſs would do to the ſame Liquors boyled therein; if any taſte hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, it is from ſome aduſt ſoods burnt to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or ſides of the Veſſel, or the like ſluttiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In vain therefore are all our decoctions of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Gold in Water, Milk, or Broth; the Cordial help thence expected as frivolous; for all compact Metalline bodies, muſt have proper and peculiar <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums</hi> to unlock them, if any medicinal <hi>Arcanum</hi> be thence expected.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Doctor tells us, That by this way of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, the <hi>Sc rbrough Spaw</hi> partakes of Vitriol, and of Iron: That Vitriol may diſſolve in ſimple Water, we have before granted; but that it ſhould give a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41152:15"/>to the Water, I underſtand not. To make a Body reſolve it ſelf into vapours, or minute parts of the like nature with the whole, is required, as I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, either an intrinſick or extrinſick heat, or fire; which or theſe two, the Vitriol of <hi>Spaw</hi> water hath, the Doctor would have done well to have aſſign'd: If he intend an intrinſick, <hi>Ubi iſte focus, ille vulcanus ubi;</hi> what Rule acts it by, that it ſhould ſo conſtantly and ſtrongly reſolve the Vitriol into minute vaporous parts, which according to the nature of a vapour, ſhould take wings, and quickly flie from this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and yet the Carkaſs of Vitriol to remain, for he ſaith nothing to the contrary, but that it is actually and ſubſtantially Vitriol ſtill; if ſo, then the vapour is Vitriol, and the Vitriol a meer vapour; for the way and means by which he makes the Water partake of Vitriol, is by its vapour; and yet this vapour is Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, being one of his aſſigned principles: What to make of this, or how to make it hang together, really I cannot tell.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If he underſtand an extrinſick heat, it muſt ſurely be from the Sun, which it muſt either reſolve the Vitriol into a vapour, where the ſpring appears <hi>ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dio;</hi> or if its heat penetrate the Superficies of the Earth, he muſt aſſign how deep its Rayes pierceth; and that the Vitriol muſt of neceſſity be wrought upon at ſuch a depth within ground, which he may do well for ſatisfaction, and ſtrengthning his principles, (leſt they run to ruine) aſſign its place, and manner of converſion into vapour, otherwiſe one of his props will of neceſſity fall under him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As Vitriol (how true judge) ſo Iron, he ſaith, gives it ſelf by a vapour to the Water; which that it doth not as a compact body, of that Metal we have already ſufficiently aſſerted, inaſmuch as Iron being a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41152:15"/>ſolid body, is not at all apt to vapour; and if it ſhould, whether or no that were yet Iron, which according to his Theſis muſt of neceſſity be, becauſe a conſtitutive principle; ſo that conſequently Iron, before it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Ingredient of the <hi>Spaw</hi> muſt be reſolv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a vapour; but by what Agent, I wiſh the Doctor would ſignifie: And when it is a vapour, how comes it to reaſſume a body, which it muſt do to make it a real principle? and what is it that bears up the body of the Iron in the Water, that it falls not like other Iron, or a <hi>Calx</hi> to the bottom? What makes the difference betwixt it and a <hi>Crocus,</hi> which, if put into Spring wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſinks to the bottom like Sand, and gains no ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Theſe things he ought to have been clear in, before he impoſed that upon the World, as an Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of this Mineral Water.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But to make up the matter, he tells us, That not only by Vapour, thoſe two bodies, Vitriol and Iron become principles; but alſo ſomething of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete juyces, and ſubſtance of them both, are given to the Water. Here the Doctor would almoſt make us believe, That he was inclinable to Philoſophiſe; for he is got as far as the concrete juyces, <hi>viz.</hi> the Metals <hi>in principiis ſolutis,</hi> or <hi>in fieri;</hi> which indeed whil'ſt ſuch are communicable to any current vein of Water, which glide along the Surface, or pervades the more ſoft body of the Mineral; at leaſtwiſe to a current of Water that hath but got the leaſt actuation from an Eſſurine Salt; but that he ſpoils all again, by bringing in Vitriol and Iron as two diſtinct things, which, as we ſhewed before, are but one in any ſubterraneal Mineral ſolution.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Had the Doctor ſpoken of the Minera of Iron, and ſo to have been in its concrete juyce, and omitted that of Vitriol or had he ſpoke of Vitriol as the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41152:16"/>Minera of Iron, and ſo have underſtood of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete juyce, rejecting the body of Iron as imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, we ſhould then have thought he had Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis'd in good earneſt, as having thence ſome perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent principles, from whence he might have rais'd a noble Structure of Theory.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. From the vapours of Vitriol (he ſaith) the Waters hath its inky ſmell, and acid taſte; and here, methinks, his vapours flies at random, it's a thouſand to one but they may in a little time quit their paces from this Well, and leave it to be poſſeſt by ſome other more natural Native: I cannot paſs the Notion without a ſmile: But to be ſerious; Firſt, What is it that gives an inky ſmell, or rather makes-Ink? Is it not a ſolution of Vitriol precipitated, or made opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous by the addition of Galls, whoſe ſtipticity makes the diaphaneous texture of the Particles in the vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſolution deſert their former poſture, and muſter in a confus'd opacous manner, filling thoſe interſtices with ſolid Particles, which before were kept tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by the fluid parts of Water equally contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and not a vapour from the Vitriol, lince there wants an heat in either Agent which might procure a vapour.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. From the concrete juyces of Vitriol, Iron and Allom (ſaith the Doctor) I think it hath its azure sky colour, by which it ſeems, as if precarious Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy were in faſhion with the Doctor; for in many places of his Book, you will find his Aſſertions and Solutions of <hi>Phenomena's</hi> (if I may ſo call them) to be meerly precarious [I think] and all for want of a good <hi>apparatus</hi> of Chymical, or other ſorts of Experiments; the want of which doth ever and anon make him, <hi>inter multa vacillare,</hi> as not having <hi>Ariad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> clew of Experiments to guide and extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41152:16"/>from Labyrinths, he is ever and anon falling foul upon thoſe two Rocks of Vitriol and Iron; and I wiſh he ſuffer not Shipwrack upon them, and in the concluſion loſe them too.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That it wants not the ſubſtance of Iron, is (he ſaith) apparent, in that after it hath been boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and put into Oken Veſſels for ſome while, there appears a reddiſh Sand inclining to yellow, which he ſaith is nothing elſe, but <hi>Mater ferri,</hi> or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. If ſo, then what becomes of his other grand principle Vitriol? for every Vitriol hath a <hi>Colcotur,</hi> or <hi>Terra Metallica</hi> in it, which may be made either yellow, red, or purple, according to the ſeveral ways of ſeparating its connate vitrioline Salt, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hinted, how will he diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotar</hi> of his aſſigned Vitriol, and this <hi>Mater ferri,</hi> being according to his Aſſertion both diſtinct Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients? ſurely all the Art he hath, can ſcarce hinder, but they will coincide, and forfeit their marks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; and ſo we may further Query, how came the Doctor to know that both Vitriol and Iron were Ingredients, ſeeing the badges of diſtinction claſh? but ſurely he took them in, pitying to ſeparate Kinſmen.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 4.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe ſecond way whereby water may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe the nature and virtue of a Mineral or Metal, is (he ſaid) when ſome of their juyce is diſſolv'd in the Water, and that is while the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals are but young, <hi>in fieri,</hi> or <hi>in ſolutis principiis.</hi> Here indeed the Doctor hath ſpoke like a Philoſopher, and hath hit the nail exactly on the head; for this is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41152:17"/>the moſt probable way of all for Minerals or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, whilſt <hi>in ſucco primitivo, in ente primo ſolubili,</hi> to communicate themſelves and virtues to current ſtreams of ſubterraneal Channels of Water, they are only then fit to propagate themſelves for Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal help in Springs, that thence become and are truly called Mineral Waters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nay, if the Metals themſelves ſhould be forc'd to open their treaſures for Medical <hi>Arcana's</hi> for the health of Man (with which they are doubtleſs nobly inriched) it muſt be by a reduction of them, by ſome powerful <hi>Menſtruums</hi> into their <hi>prima entia,</hi> into their firſt liquid principles and juyces, whereby they would notably penetrate our very conſtitutions, and therewith, <hi>quadam Symphonia colludere, abſtergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do penetrando ac illum inando Archeum vitalem ex morbis tum acutis tum cronicis ſolvendo.</hi> But <hi>not nobis liceat eſſe tam diſſert os.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third way, he ſaith, is by corroſion of the ſubſtances of the Minerals mentioned by <hi>Gallen,</hi> and this is performed by the help of the concrete juyces, which corrode and extract Mineral Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; here we find a <hi>Galenical</hi> way of ſolution of Minerals in Waters, and ſo indeed it ſeems; for as its out of their road to diſcourſe of theſe Mineral ſolutions, ſo their notions muſt be confus'd becauſe not grounded on true chymical experiments, which they are not at leiſure to take notice of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For you ſee the Doctor ſaith, that theſe concrete juyces, corrode and extract Mineral Subſtances, which tacitly involves no leſs than a contradiction; in as much as theſe concrete juyces are Minerals <hi>in fieri,</hi> or as he ſaith <hi>in principiis ſolutis,</hi> and yet he would have thoſe Minerals to corrode and extract Minerals, the ſame body extract the ſame body. In every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41152:17"/>is required a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> or <hi>Solvent,</hi> and a body to be diſſolv'd; but here, according to his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, the <hi>Solvent</hi> and <hi>Solvable</hi> are both one, the Agent and the Patient the ſame; which how he could ſolve from claſhing, gladly would I learn.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But he goes on further to illuſtrate this his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite contradiction, telling us, that this very way of extraction, is done by ſuch as have imbibed Vitriol at the firſt; for they do thereby (ſaith he) become hungry and corroſive, and ſo the fitter to take into them any other Mineral that lies in their way: thus he thinks he carrys it away clearly; but ſtay, you may remember we told you (<hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>No.</hi> 7.) that an Eſſurine Salt diſſolv'd in a Water Spring, meeting with the Minera of any Metal that it can work upon, turns it into a Vitriol, and that either pertaking of Iron or Copper, according to the nature of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera it meets with, which done, its diſſolving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is terminated, and can ask no more; therefore the Water having, according to the Doctors ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, imbibed Vitriol, is not at leiſure to make any further corroſions, or extractions, and ſo the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would prove barren, as to any other Minerals.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To confirm all, as he thinks, he ſeconds his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory with an Example, which deſerves an exemplar remark upon it; it's thus, An Example whereof, ſaith he, we ſee in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> which will corrode the ſubſtance of another Metal, and convert it into its own nature; and there methinks the Doctor was no great Chymiſt, if he had, he would ſurely have bluſht to have own'd that <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> having corroded a Metal, ſhould convert the Metal into its own nature.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For diſſolve either Copper or Iron, Silver or Gold, or any other Metal in an <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and you ſhall have all the Metal again <hi>(idem numero &amp; ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re)</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41152:18"/>either by precipitation with a <hi>Lixivium</hi> or Oyl of <hi>Tartar per deliquium,</hi> or by evaporating the corroſive <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> then edultorating, and firing ſtrongly in a cruſible until it flux, and you ſhall have it return'd you the ſame Metal as at firſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. So that the Metal corroded by the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> was not (according to the Doctors fallacious aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) converted into the nature of the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its parts only forcibly ſevered by the freting corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, reunitable, after the ſeparation of the <hi>Menſtruum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. But it ſeems the Doctor is willing to take principles upon truſt, and therefore his concluſions and examples (which ſhould indeed be the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative) prove invalid and unſatisfactory, to a judicious eye that takes no notice of vulgar principles further than conſonant to truth.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. He ſuppoſeth (as far as I can gather from his manner of writing) that becauſe when a Metal is diſſolv'd in an <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> it ſeems to the eye to be all liquid, and as it were turn'd into the form of the very <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that therefore it is converted into the nature of the <hi>Aqua fortis;</hi> which it's true a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar judgment, inſtructed no otherwiſe than by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Opticks, would apprehend as the Doctor doth, that it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Metal, is converted into the nature of the <hi>Aqua fortis;</hi> but let the ſame eye proceed, and view it when the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is ſeparated, and it is reduced <hi>ſtatu quo prius</hi> by fire, being forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to depoſit its corroſive mask, will confeſs it was but <hi>deceptio viſus</hi> all this while, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal howſoever corroded by the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> was the ſame Metal ſtill.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="section">

                  <head>SECT. 5.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe fourth and laſt way whereby water imbibes the nature and virtue of a Mineral or Metal, is, as he ſaith, by confuſion, changing the ſubſtance of the Mineral into Water: This ſolution I muſt needs confeſs is very confus'd, jumping ſo narrowly with the precedent, as that it ſcarce miſſeth it an hairs bredth, and therefore muſt needs bear the name of confuſion, <hi>fruſtra fit per plura quod fiat per pauciora;</hi> for here he is of the ſame judgment as before; that a Mineral may be converted (to uſe his own term) into Water.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it may be there is a myſtery wrapt in it, perhaps Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> deeply Phyloſophiſeth, and we are not aware of it; for now that I recollect my ſelf, I remember <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi> tells us of their grand Liquor <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> which <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cuncta naturae corpora penetrando ſubtilliandoque tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutat;</hi> and further ſaith, that by it, <hi>(viz. primum ens ſalium) omne corpus (puta Saxum) lapidem, gemmam, ſilicem, arenam, marcaſitam argillam, terram lapides coctos, vitrum, calcem, Sulphur, &amp;c.</hi> (much more Minerals, ſuch as the Doctor means) <hi>tranſmutari in ſalem actualem, aequiponderante ſuo corpori, unde factus eſt. Et quod iſte ſal aliquoties cohobatus in ſale circulato</hi> Paracelſi; <hi>ſuam omnino fixitatem amittat tandem tranſmutetur in liquorem, qui etiam tandem in aquam inſipidam tranſit, &amp; quod iſta aqua aequiponderet ſali ſuo, unde manavit;</hi> by which Liquor tranſmuting all bodies, whether Stones, Metals or Minerals into a Salt, which cohobated with <hi>Paracelſus, Sal circulatum</hi> (which by the by, is <hi>primum ens Mercurii Liquidum cum primo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41152:19"/>ente ſalis factum</hi>) is at length tranſmuted, or turn'd into an inſipid Water.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet certainly if he had had ſuch a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> we ſhould have heard of it ere this, but I ſee not the leaſt foot-ſtep yet in his Book that might give the leaſt hint thereof; by which I gather he is not ſo well vers'd amongſt Pyrotecnick Writers, as to inſinuate ſo ſecret and Phyloſophical tranſmutation of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals into Water.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is ſo far I fear from a Phyloſophical, as that I doubt it may prove a Ruſtical notion, <hi>viz.</hi> to judge a Mineral or Metal tranſmutable into Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſo ſeems to be to a vulgar eye; the body of the Celeſtial Sun to be no bigger than a Buſhel, or a Cart Wheel at the moſt, becauſe appearing no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the ſame common eye.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He would confirm this vulgar Doctrine (Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar I call it, becauſe fited only for Ruſticks, whoſe reaſon outſtrip not their ſenſe; but for a profeſt Phyſician, ſhould me-thinks have the pole of his reaſon more elevated) I ſay he would by the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Salt, Nitre and Allom confirm this his Doctrine (to be found no where but amongſt vulgar errors) inſtancing and ſaying, that Salt and Nitre will both ſo perfectly turn into Water (and Allom alſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not ſo fuſible as the other) a little being put to them, as if they were nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By which I perceive the Doctor doth really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that when Salt or Nitre is diſſolv'd in Water, that they are no longer Salt or Water, but really tranſmuted, or (as his own term is) converted into Water. O facile tranſmutation! what need we caſt about, at ſuch far diſtances to inquire after the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and truth of tranſmutation of Metalline or Mineral ſubſtances, when the Doctor hath got them
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41152:19"/>ſo near at hand, can turn Mineral ſubſtances into Water, and every whit as eaſily reduce them into what they were before.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For he hath given a poſitive reſolve of the Quere of tranſmutation, having abſolutely determined, that theſe Salts do perfectly turn into Water, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own words, a little Water being put to them; which through reſolution of the point, is totally excluſive of either his <hi>magis</hi> or <hi>minus,</hi> ſo that according to his opinion, Salt put into Broth becomes Broth, and Sugar diſſolv'd in White-wine or Sack, becomes White-wine or Sack; whereas any of theſe Liquors evaporated or diſtill'd, he will find beſides the whole body of the wateriſh part ſaved in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, the body of Salt or Sugar left entire in the diſtilling veſſel, the very ſame as before.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This peripatetick notion, I look upon no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than that other analogous to it; where in the ſame <hi>Sect.</hi> he ſaith that Water would evaporate into Ayr, ſuppoſing a tranſmutability of Elements, as if Water when evaporating were not as really Water, though its parts undergo a large extenſion, as when the parts are united in a fluid body, in that texture of parts which the body of Water makes up; for ſave in a receiver, that which he imagines evaporates into Ayr, and you ſhall find, and ſo ſhall he too, that it is no way diſtinguiſhable from that it was before, Water ſtill and not Ayr; ſo Salts, Sugars, or what elſe diſſolvable in Water, are the ſame as at the firſt, though appearing under the form of Water.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For whatſoever is diſſolv'd in Water, if upon the ſuperfuſion of any other Liquor of a different property, the parts of the firſt diſſolvable begin to alter their poſition, they either precipitate ſpeedily, or make the Liquor opacous and in time precipitates,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41152:20"/>leaving the water either partly acuated with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Liquor, or elſe inſipid, having all the ſaline parts coagulated one upon another, which being waſh't or dulcified, gives you the very ſame diſſolvable Concrete you firſt took in hand.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. As for inſtance, Diſſolve Vitriol in water, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſo as it become a clear ſolution, upon which pour a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of ſalt of Tartar, and you ſhall find im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the firſt diſſolvable, <hi>viz.</hi> the vitrioline col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotar together with part of both the ſalts, <hi>i. e.</hi> the acid connate ſalt of the vitriol and lixivial ſalt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated; after precipitation, the ſupernatant Liquor contains in it a <hi>neutrum,</hi> or <hi>tertium quid,</hi> from both the foreſaid ſalts, which it will make to appear by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration and evaporation in the form of a <hi>Tartarum vitriolatum;</hi> the Sediment which was precipitated gives the <hi>Terra vitrioli,</hi> or metalline earth of vitriol; all which happen from a complication of heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts in the firſt diſſolvable, <hi>viz.</hi> vitriol, having in it a metalline earth (only to be made apparent, in the form of a metal by force of fire) and an eſſurine acid ſalt, which ſalt, meeting with a lixivial ſalt, lets go its firſt diſſolvable, and coagulates it ſelf upon the laſt.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But take a ſingle ſalt, as ſuppoſe ſalt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or the fixt ſalt of any vegetable, diſſolve it in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; upon which ſtrong ſolution, pour diſtilled Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, Oyl of Vitriol, Spirit of Nitre, or Spirit of Salt, or any of them, or the like acid ſaline Liquors; and you ſhall find that after a ſtrong ebullition and boyling which they cauſe by fretting one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, cauſing a very intenſe heat, that in the mutual, and as it were hoſtile action of the ſalt; one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, they precipitate each other to the bottom, and leave the ſupernatant Liquor in a manner inſipid: But to return.</p>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41152:20"/>12. He concludes this laſt manner of ſolution in confuſion, by an example of the <hi>Spaw</hi> water; five quarts whereof being evaporated over the fire, there will be found in the bottom of the Veſſel, an ounce of an aſh-coloured blackiſh Sediment, a conſiderable part whereof is Nitre, Allom, and Salt, the reſt the ſubſtance of Iron and Vitriol: This is, according to his laſt Hypotheſis, confuſion in good earneſt; for here all the Ingredients are confuſed, and jumbled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and by what Art the Doctor will learn to ſeparate them, that they may indeed appear to be ſo many as he ſpeaks of, I know not, I think it would puzzle all his method to extricate them.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. One Argument more I ſhall produce againſt his two Ingredients in the body of Iron and Vitriol, and this ſhall be <hi>inſtar omnium,</hi> as being demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and confirm'd by <hi>Autopſia;</hi> An ingenious Friend of mine, whom I ſhall not otherwiſe name, than the Chymical Apothecary of <hi>York,</hi> had a parcel of this aſh-coloured Powder, which remained in the bottom of the Veſſel after the diſtillation, or evaporation of the water of this <hi>Spaw,</hi> given him by Dr. WITTIE himſelf; This he put into a crucible, and gave a very ſtrong calcining fire (as ſtrong as for the calcining of Vitriol into Colcotar) and that for the ſpace of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt three hours, and all this while without the leaſt appearance of any red colour, or the leaſt footſtep of either Colcotar or Vitriol, or Crocus of Iron, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came fixt and permanent in the fire, and loſt little of its weight; it alſo became whiter in colour.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Now for certain, if there had been any thing of Vitriol or Iron in it, the diſcovery would have been made, and it forc't to confeſs its nature, by its yellow, red, or purple colour, with ſo great force of fire.</p>

This fixt Powder having thus indured the higheſt degrees of heat, was diſſolved, filtred, and evaporated, which when dry, became a moſt pure white clean Salt; that part of it which would not diſſolve, and conſequently not paſs the filter, being dryed, was an almoſt inſipid aſh-coloured Powder, ſomewhat whiter than that which was firſt taken: Thus we diſcard theſe two Pillars of his <hi>Spaw,</hi> viz.

                  <p n="1">1. AFter the Doctor hath declar'd theſe ſeveral wayes, whereby Waters are impregnated with Minerals; and we as cloſely followed him, to ſee whether it were ſo or no: He proceeds to tell us the nature and virtue of theſe Minerals; firſt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, he ſaith, it is eminently hot, of a biting and aduſtive quality, and yet is alſo ſtiptick and aſtrictive, and therefore dries up ſuperfluous humidity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the account that he receives from <hi>Galen, Diaſcorides, Serapio, Paulus, Oribatius, Aelius, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarius, Fernelius.</hi> (enough to tire one in the naming) it is a very ſhort abreviary from ſo great a number of Authors, concerning that Mineral, which well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and the Remedies thereof neatly prepared, would make up, as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, a fourth Column of Medicine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But methinks the Doctor's long experience <hi>in re medica</hi> ſhould ere this have furniſhed him plenty of obſervations, of the worth and virtue of ſo noble a Mineral (unleſs <hi>inopem ſe copia fecit</hi>) he hath ſuch ſtore that he knows not where to begin; Theſe biting and aduſtive, ſtiptick, and aſtrictive qualities of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, muſt ſurely belong to it, either as it is an intire
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41152:21"/>body, of Vitriol, or to the conſtitutive parts and principles of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If theſe his aſſigned qualities, as he calls them, belong to Vitriol intirely as ſuch, then he muſt needs mean the common Vitriol; if he mean any other ſort, why did not he for diſtinction ſake name it? But what Phyſician uſeth to preſcribe common Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol unprepared for his Patient, being crudely given, a very nauſeating and violent cmetick to the ſtomach, and not a proper Medicine for an honeſt man to uſe; and I believe the Doctor himſelf never gave it, unleſs it was to try an experiment; and if he had given it, I am apt to think it as difficult to have learn'd thence his forced qualities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If theſe qualities are aſcribed to it, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered reſolv'd into its conſtitutive parts, then he would have done well to have anatomiz'd it, and told us to which parts, ſuch and ſuch virtues and qualities did belong; whether it was to the Salt, to the Oyl, to the Spirit or Phlegm, to the Colcotar, or to any Arcana's ſingly or jointly, thence prepar'd, and then we ſhould have had ſome diſtinct knowledge of what he propounds.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It's probable he takes Vitriol to be a ſimple Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Salt, not admitting it to be compounded of thoſe Ingredients, which muſt neceſſarily go to its natural <hi>geneſis,</hi> and hence depends all his grand miſtakes concerning that concrete; but why do I trouble my ſelf or the Reader, in expoſtulating thoſe properties of which the Doctor is ſo barren, as what he gives us, is not from himſelf, but from <hi>Gallen, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorides, Serapio, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Iron is the next, which he ſaith is dry in the third degree; here we ſee that as the <hi>Galleniſts</hi> have their degrees of the four qualities, by which they feel
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41152:22"/>and handle as it were the virtues and properties of Vegetables; ſo likewiſe it ſeems they reach with them to fathom the nature of Metals: I would only Query how they come to know that Iron is dry in the third degree? Is not Iron as well as other Metals liquid or dry, fluid or permanent, according as they undergo the force of fire in fuſion? which while ſo in a crucible makes them liquid and fluid like water, by actuating their Mercurial part, which involving the Sulphur of the Metal, makes it flow together with it, as if it were nothing elſe but <hi>Mercury,</hi> which when cool again, is <hi>in ſtatu quo prius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. But what this third degree of dryneſs is, of which Iron is found to be, I know not, I wiſh the Doctor knew himſelf, and if he could to certifie theſe dry notions; he ſaith alſo that it is ſtiptick, drying up the ſuperfluous humidities of the body, ſomewhat like to Vitriol: This wonted diſcourſe of <hi>Galleniſts</hi> ever and anon to theſe exotick qualities, make no ſolid ſatisfactory Solutions of Philoſophical Queries.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For if a man ſhould ask them, how Iron, even the very body of Iron given in filings ſometimes, or any good Preparation of Iron, as for inſtance, <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charum Martis, viz.</hi> Sugar of Steel, become very frequently Medicines proper to Cure (if rightly managed) the Dropſie, Scurvy, <hi>Cachexia, defectus Menſtruorum, &amp;c.</hi> it's very probable their anſwer will be, That they do it by their drying quality, by exiccating the ſuperfluous humours of the body; now theſe notions of qualities, are moſtwhat groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon ſenſe; as for inſtance, in this very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the moſt ſuperfluous humours in the Dropſie, are, in a <hi>Gallenical</hi> ſenſe, comparable to a mixture, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Water and Meal in order to making of Bread,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41152:22"/>if the Water out proportion the Meal, it's no way at preſent to be corrected but by addition of more dry Meal, and that ſo much as will bring it into a due conſiſtence, ſo drying up the ſuperfluous moiſture.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Thus analogically the ſuperfluous humours of hydropick and ſcorbutick bodies are as we ſay to be dryed up by thoſe Medicines, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drying qualities be exiccating in ſuch and ſuch degrees, ſoke up theſe moiſt Diſtempers, and ſo effect their Cures? which moiſt notion a few Queries will eaſily pump dry: As,</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Firſt, how do theſe dry qualities act? are not the ſuperfluous humours of theſe moiſt Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers moſt what in the blood, diluting and making it too wateriſh? how muſt therefore theſe drying qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities reach the corrigible moiſture? are they not firſt to paſs the ſtomach and its ferment, which no doubt muſt have pretty ſtore of moiſture, proper for the abſolving its own peculiar functions? and doth the Doctor think theſe drying qualities will not bait and take a ſup in the road? ſure enough if they be dry they will: Doth he imagine they can paſs the ſtomach, that <hi>culina humorum,</hi> without acting upon its moiſture, unleſs he grant they act electively, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves, This is not the moiſture the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſent us to dry up, but we muſt paſs into the blood and other humours of the body, to dry up what is ſuperfluous there.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But if he ſay that there are alſo ſuperfluous moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in the ſtomach, which feed thoſe of the blood and other parts, and therefore muſt alſo be dryed up; which ſuppoſe we grant, yet while theſe drying qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are acting, drying up the moiſture they meet with, what ſhould hinder but they ſhould alſo dry up the natural innate moiſture of the ſtomach, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41152:23"/>ſo cauſe by their ſtiptick quality a clinging of the Membranes of the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> and <hi>Ventricle?</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moiſture as ſuch, whether in <hi>equilibrio humorum,</hi> or in exorbitancy, is the proper object for theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to work upon, unleſs he will ſay they act ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, which would be abſurd enough.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. So that by that time thoſe qualities (if any ſuch there be) had got through the ſtomach, they would be ſo tempered with a competent moiſture, as that they would loſe themſelves, and become no qualities, and the expected Cure to be done by them would be left to ſuch as ſhould come after.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Again, the Doſe of ſuch drying Medicines, how large ſhould they be to imbibe and dry up ſuch great quantities of ſuperfluous humours, as is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to be found in dropſical bodies? ſurely if they ſhould give Steel in ſo great a quantity, as to dry up ſo great a bulk of ſpurious humidities; when it had done its work, it would certainly reſtagnate in the veſſels, and cauſe greater obſtructions then was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. As for <hi>Saccharum Martis,</hi> it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given in a Vehicle, either of Wine or Water, and how this ſhould dry is another Query; for me-thinks it were enough to daſh the drying quality of Steel with the very moiſture of the Vehicle it is given in, and for this Sugar of Steel thus given in a Vehicle, to exiccate ſuperfluous humidities, is as much as if they ſhould ſay, a moiſt body ought to dry up a moiſt body, which how contradictory, it's enough to name; ſo likewiſe thoſe decoctions of <hi>Sarſaparilla, China,</hi> and <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> which they ſo much cant to to be drying decoctions, are altogether as irrational as the former, for to call the decoctions of theſe Diaphoreticks forenamed drying decoctions, implies
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41152:23"/>no leſs than a palpable contradiction; for the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Diaphoreticks, are drying only <hi>à poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori,</hi> by carrying through the pores of the body, by inſenſible tranſpiration or ſweat, that ſuperfluous <hi>latex</hi> which cumbers the blood, and not that they actually dry by a poſitive quality.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But that I may give you one ſleight hint, concerning the manner of the operation of Iron in the Cures of the formerly named Diſeaſes, and that without taking cognizance of any drying or ſtiptick qualities; it is thus, Firſt we muſt preſuppoſe there are ſeveral digeſtive ferments in the body, which if regular and uninterupted in their functions, are the Authors of tranſmuting edible food, from one manner of juyce or liquor into another, until it terminate in nutrition, coming for a ſupply of the continual waſting and tranſpiring ſpirits, which ſo long keeps an occonomy and harmony of parts, ſubſervient to the health and vivacity of the body.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. If theſe digeſtions by any occaſional cauſe of inordinacy of living, perturbations or paſſions of the mind, <hi>ex in equale partium robore ab origine nato,</hi> or any other eſſential or accidental cauſe of Diſeaſes, become irregular, degenerating from their primitive intentions, perverting their original juyces, thence a ſpurious acidity becomes exorbitant (although a chiliferous acid ferment is peculiar to that digeſtion of the ſtomach) <hi>extra lares ſuos fertur in alienam menſem reliquarum digeſtionum;</hi> fluctuates in the veſſels, being too much heightened or decocted in the ſtomach it ſelf, cauſing Heart-burnings, Pains and Gripings, and ſometimes Vomiting, deſcending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inteſtines, cauſeth the Collick and Illiack Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this getting into the veins and arteries, becomes the intrinſick Minera of Feavers, <hi>&amp; mortis inopinati.</hi>

                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41152:24"/>17. The ſame vitiating the ſpirituous Liquor of the <hi>genus nervoſum,</hi> gives the ſeminary of Apoplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, Palſies, Spaſmes, and Convulſions; alſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating it ſelf upon the bowels, cauſeth obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thence oedematous and ſcirrhous tumours of the Spleen or Liver, and lays the ground-work for Apoſthumations in other parts; the ſame acting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly upon different parts vitiates their ſpermatick elementary Liquor, diſtends the fibres of the parts beyond their natural tone; perverting their periſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick motion, whereby the ſuperfluous watry parts, ſhould be percolated from the Blood by Urine, Sweat, and inſenſible tranſpiration; which diſtention (and ſometimes flagging of the fibres, having original often from the ſame) dilutes the Blood, by retaining what ſhould be ſeparated thence, whence come Dropſies.</p>
                  <p n="18">18.

                  <p n="19">19.

                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. I ſay the manner of operation of Steel, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther filings, <hi>Crocus,</hi> or Sugar of Steel, is by coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating this excrementitious Salt, which becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, is therefore partly Mineral; for as ſoon as Steel aforeſaid enters the ſtomach, and ſo paſſeth from the firſt to the ſecond digeſtion in the inteſtines, as it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth along, the ſpurious Salt runs head-long towards it to diſſolve it, but inſtead thereof is coagulated thereon, ſpending its activity upon the Steel, loſeth its accuteneſs or ſting, and ſo is carryed away with the Steel by Stool; hence the excrements of thoſe that have taken Chalibeat Medicines are black, and that for no other reaſon, but that the corroſive fretting Spirits, and ſpurious acid juyces of the body (thoſe grand authors of pains and torments) are precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Chalibeate body, which by coagulation thereon grows black.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Hence it is that thoſe corroſive fretting, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and acid juyces, which vellicate and prick the Nerves, in whatſoever part of the body they are found, and twinge the Fibrous parts of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, throughout the whole body, <hi>utpote patrones dolorum ac torminum,</hi> are I ſay dinted, ſoftned, and ſweetned, by the taking in ſuch fixed bodies of the Metalline compage of Steel, or of animal or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

All which petrefied animal or vegetable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete juyces, as alſo <hi>teſtacea quaevis,</hi> together with the body of Steel, being taken into the humane body, do coagulate the preternatural acid juyces upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and do ſo alter the texture of the whole maſs of humours, that whereas before by their fretting nature, they cauſed the floting to and again through the body, divers Pains, Swellings, Indiſpoſitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are now become ſweet, and circulate in the body in a due proportion, proper for the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſeveral digeſtions.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Even after the ſame manner as we ſenſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that when they are put into any ſort of acid Liquors, as Vineager or the like, though their powders fall to the bottom, yet they give not over working one upon another, until the acid Liquor hath become ſweet, <hi>viz.</hi> inſipid, robbing it thereby of its ſowrneſs; the like doth almoſt any Metal diſſolv'd in an <hi>Aqua fortis;</hi> which thence ſeparated by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or precipitation, becomes moſt what debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; ſo that it ſhall not be able to make another the like ſolution.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Hence we may throughly reſolve that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objection, which might ſtare us in the face, at the very firſt propoſal, of this Hypotheſis; <hi>viz.</hi> that ſeeing the Metalline body of Steel, or petrefied concretions of Coral, Pearl, and Crabs Eyes, being yet in the ſtomach, or on their paſſage through the ſecond digeſtion, along the inteſtines, do even there ſweeten the acid juyces of the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they themſelves <hi>(viz.)</hi> the acid juyces may be in more remote parts, and at a great diſtance;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41152:25"/>how comes it therefore that theſe remote corroſive pontick juyces, become dulcified at a diſtance?</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Which we anſwer, firſt, by obſerving to you, that if you put the powders of Pearl, Coral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into a glaſs, upon which pour diſtilled Vinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or the like, you may obſerve that though the powder lie in the bottom, and the Liquor only touch it ſuperficially (and therefore according to the form of the Objection, ſhould only alter and ſweeten thoſe very parts only which they touch) yet in a little time we ſee it ſweetens the whole maſs of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and that upon this reaſon, as I apprehend, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the nature of water conſiſting in fluidity, is always in motion, ſo that in a little time all the parts of water, whirl and circle about ſo long, till they have all touch'd the powder, and all thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a like dulcification; ſo in like manner the juyces of the body being liquid, do ſo circulate about by reaſon of their fluidity, that in a little time there be few parts of the body, through which the fluid juyces have not circulated, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently meet with thoſe bodies (if any ſuch thing be inwardly taken, as may rob them of their ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſharpneſs) which being <hi>extra lares,</hi> prove hoſtile to the Nerves, Veins, Arteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. Another inſtance, let Silver be diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> there the corroſive <hi>Menſtruum</hi> hath totally (though not radically) diſſolv'd the body of the Metal, upon which it is alſo coagulated, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in a liquid form, if into this, ſomewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with water, you put plates of Copper, as Refiners ſometimes do for the ſeparating of Silver, you will find the Silver deſert the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitating upon the cuprous plates, and will thereby be totally ſeparated from the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41152:26"/>too, notwithſtanding the plates (as they always do) lie conſtantly in the bottom of the Veſſel.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. You will ask, how comes the upper part of the reſtagnant <hi>Menſtruum</hi> (which hath an equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Silver in it, as well as the lower part thereof) to be acted upon by the plates at ſuch a diſtance? to which as before I reply, That the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid parts of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> being in a conſtant motion of fluidity, and carrying the diſſolved Metal in it, doth in a little time circulate all the parts of the Veſſel, as far as the upper ſuperficies thereof, one place conſtantly changing places with another, till they have at length all glided along the ſurface of the plates, which by a peculiar Metallick aſſimilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, put a ſtop to its current in the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and hooks it to it ſelf; which is one of the beſt and moſt thorough ſeparations of Silver that is commonly known.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. The like is done if Copper be diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> if plates of Iron be put therein, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating the Copper from the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and that by the great affinity or likeneſs of texture of parts of thoſe two Metals.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Thus in like manner, when any good preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Steel, of Pearl, of Coral, and Crabs Eyes are given, though they themſelves paſs actually no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than into the firſt and ſecond digeſtion, and ſo proceed, yet being all the juyces and liquors of the body are in a conſtant fluid motion, and always circulating, therefore of courſe they muſt in time touch upon theſe forenamed fixed concretes, which if they touch they loſe their pontick ſharpneſs, by which they become hoſtile to nature, and have laid the foundation of many Diſeaſes; which thus being dulcified, the juyces do <hi>redire in gratiam,</hi> and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late as good companions as ever.</p>
                  <p n="30">
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41152:26"/>30. Steel, our now preſent ſubject, operates by ſeparating this corroſive acidity, which had coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it ſelf upon the bowels, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spleen, Liver, Matrix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſpurious ſowrneſs meeting with a body to which it claims more affinity, then to the parts it had ſettled it ſelf upon, joyns with it and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes coagulated thereon; and ſo the bowels become ſet at liberty from their former obſtructions, and the circulation of the blood and humours become thereby more florid, the exorbitant latex, which before was extravaſated, runs in its own chanels again; and what was ſuperfluous that would not <hi>redire in gratiam,</hi> Nature finds ſome peculiar manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion or other, either of Stool, Urine, Sweat, or inſenſible Tranſpiration.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Thus the Dropſie and Scurvy, <hi>Cachexia, defectus Menſtruorum, &amp;c.</hi> become Cured; beſides which, we might name many more Diſeaſes, which by a skilful managing and ordering of theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, might by the bleſſing of God be Cured, as the Hypocondriack Melancholly, which chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a coagulation of this <hi>Tartarum reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> this <hi>Sal excrementitium,</hi> we are now treating of, upon the Spleen, whereby its proper digeſtion, or peculiar function of ſeperation of ſome heterogenious parts from the blood is vitiated, which digeſtion of the Spleen ſo promoting the blood in its tincture, and height of ſpirituoſity, wherewith the Spleen inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that plenty and complication of Arteries, ſeems to be deſtin'd to, being no doubt thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with a noble ferment, which ſhould exalt and ſpiritualize the blood, by a kind of Chymical ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of ſome innate impurities, reſtagnant in the blood, until it come to partake of the exalting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive ferment of that part; which to me ſeems to

I ſay this fermental digeſtion of the Spleen becomes obſtructed and vitiated, by a coagulation of the foreſaid ſpurious acidity, which conſequently vitiating its next product, the nimble animal ſpirits, the very immediate corporeal Organ of the Soul; which ſpirits, if I may ſo call them, are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate corporeal reflecting glaſs of the Soul, which it uſeth for the receiving and contemplating all viſible objects; and being vitiated by ſuch an obſtructive coagulative Salt, in the Spleen, according to the ſtrength and degree of the obſtruent, is the blood perverted in its prolifick off-ſpring of animal ſpirits, which become irregular and altogether erroneous, thence making falſe repreſentations of things to the Soul, whence ſtrange fancyful apprehenſions ariſe; which excrementitious Salt, radicated in the Spleen, hath commonly a <hi>flatus</hi> concomitant, which therefore is called <hi>flatus hypochondraicus.</hi>

                  <p n="34">34. But now at length returning to view the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors qualities, methinks they begin to play leaſt in ſight, and probably may become <hi>occult;</hi> yea at length be reckoned amongſt <hi>non entia.</hi>

He tells us what <hi>Dioſcordes</hi> will have Iron to do, <hi>viz.</hi> to looſe the belly, eſpecially commending the flower or filings of Braſs to that purpoſe, this is like the reſt, incongruous; for I believe neither <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcordes,</hi> nor himſelf, ever gave the flower or filing of Braſs, if they did, at leaſt never to have had ground-work of obſerving a ſolutive property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, for (if I miſtake not) ſhould the Doctor give filings of Copper to any Patient of his, he would find that by that time the filings had got into the ſtomach, and had become fret upon, by the acid ferment thereof, it would preſently become deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately emetick, being by that time become as violent a Vomiter, as if ſo much <hi>viride aris,</hi> or common Vitriol had been taken.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Now Iron (ſaith he) being joyned with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol in this water, partakes of the nature of Braſs, and is therefore the more purging and opening, from which conjunction I think it is, that moſt of our Vitrioline Waters in <hi>England</hi> do looſen the belly; which if it be true that Iron joyned with Vitriol in this water, partakes of the nature of Braſs, then muſt it of neceſſity, as I ſaid before, prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly emetick, which the Doctors long experience witneſſeth to the contrary; what difference of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would it have from ſo much <hi>viride aeris</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vitriol, diſſolv'd in a large quantity of water? ſeeing that both of them are made from the body of Copper or Braſs, fretted by the acidity of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41152:28"/>Vineger, or other acid alumenous liquor; ſo that the water wherein this nature of Braſs is, becoming wrought upon by the acid ferment of the ſtomach, would certainly become as powerfully emetick, as the other, and then this Spring would loſe its good report.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. We have already ſufficiently ravell'd into the nature of both Vitriol and Iron, throughly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their inconſiſtency in a Water-ſpring, which we are loth again to repeat; therefore what we have already ſaid to that point being premiz'd, his <hi>Theſis</hi> of the reaſon of Purgation of theſe Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Waters, will naturally and of its own accord fall; in as much as any ſort of Vitriol made out of Copper or Braſs, is, as I ſaid before, dangerouſly emetick, and not fit for an honeſt Phyſician to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. ALlom is another principle, of which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Gallen,</hi> he reckons up three ſorts, all of which are of groſs parts, and very ſtiptick, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſive, heating and ſomething corroſive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſay <hi>Gallen, Oribaſius, Aetius, Serapio, Fernelius, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Which of theſe ſorts it is, that is the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of this Water, the Doctor had done well to have put the World out of doubt, for otherwiſe he leaves us in as great a Miſt, nay greater than he found us; for the deſcribing the virtues thereof, he ſeems to mean no other than that artificial factitious Allom uſed by Dyers, and Chyrurgeons, which as ſuch is a Mineral compound Salt, which no doubt if the Water have any ſuch Ingredient, muſt be a ſimple Mineral Salt, centred in the bowels of the Mineral
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41152:28"/>Stone of Allom, without any ſuperadditionary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments of Urine, Salt of Kelp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nitre, another Ingredient, is (he ſaith) of two ſorts, natural and artificial, the natural tends to a reddiſh colour, as ſaith <hi>Serapio, Gallen</hi> ſaith there is alſo a white ſort, ſo that unleſs <hi>Serapio</hi> or <hi>Gallen</hi> tell us the kinds of Nitre, we ſhall have little account thereof from Dr. WITTIE; of which white fort, he ſaith it is plain that this of ours is; I ſuppoſe he means the white natural ſort, and yet goes on without diſtinction, deſcribing the virtues of the artificial ſort, ſaying it is wont to be mixed in Medicines, when we would attenuate and deterge; it's added (he ſaith) to Cerats and Plaiſters in Diſtempers of the Nerves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By all which it ſhould ſeem indeed by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, as if this artificial kind of Nitre uſed in Shops, were the Nitrous Ingredient of the Water; and then we ſhould conſult, where thoſe <hi>Salt-peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers</hi> are, thoſe ſubterraneal nimble ſons of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> who muſt furniſh this Spring, with this artificial ſort of <hi>Salt-peter;</hi> and further query, whether (if the <hi>Troglodites</hi> knew the uſe of Sulphur and Duſt of Charcole) they might not (envying Mortals this happineſs) unfortunately (and to the great loſs of the Doctor) blow up this Spring?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Salt is the fifth and laſt Principle or Ingredient of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> perhaps becauſe it is ſo neer the Salt Water of the Sea; and indeed looking a little further, I find he ſaith he thinks it receives the Salt from the Sea, but how demonſtrable I know not; for if any ſuch Marine Salt was in this Spring, it would certainly upon diſtillation or evaporation be left in the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then would as evidently be demonſtrable by the taſte, as we ſee the Sulphur Well of <hi>Knarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi> having a body of Salt in it, upon evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41152:29"/>leaves it all behind in the bottom of the veſſel; ſo here a little proportion of Sea Salt, would make the ſediment ſufficiently brackiſh, and that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable enough, if it were there.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But we find not the leaſt foot-ſtep of any ſuch Salt left after the evaporation or diſtillation of the water, neither is any ſeparable by any known art of ſeparation of Mineral Salts; for after the ſediment of the <hi>Spaw</hi> is further calcined by the force of fire, and another ſeparation is made by ſolution, filtration, and evaporation, yet is the ſeparated Salt ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from any ſuch brackiſh taſte, as that it is quite of another perceptible taſte, ſo that the preſence of ſuch a Marine Salt is no otherwiſe than meerly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, and therefore to be taken up by praecarious Philoſophers.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.

                  <p>IT is now high-time, after the unhinging of Dr. WITTIES Principles, to come to make a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcrutiny into the real Principles of this <hi>Spaw;</hi> and though I have made Animadverſions upon all his five Ingredients, ſhewing the inconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy and inconſiſtency of them, as he hath laid them down, yet without any intention or thought of denying them all, but to hold to thoſe which we might find demonſtrable by experiment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For which intention, I went purpoſely to <hi>Scarbrough,</hi> and took along with me ſeveral Liquors and Spirits, by which, I thought, I might beſt eſſay the native Ingredients of the water; I took alſo along with me a ſolution of the five Ingredients, according to the Doctors ſuppoſition, each of them being in ſeveral glaſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſolution of Nitre, Allom, Vitriol of Copper, Vitriol of Iron, and common Salt, and deſired him, for the evincing the truth of his Principles, that he would pleaſe to mix theſe in ſuch a proportion, in a glaſs of freſh water, as might reſemble the taſte of the <hi>Spaw</hi> water, and would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with it anſwer the ſame coagulations and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So when we came to the Well, I deſired an eſſay might be made of the mixture of thoſe five ſolutions in freſh water, to try if we could imitate the <hi>Spaw</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; he told the company that I expected from thoſe Minerals which had undergone the fire, to ſee the ſame as from thoſe which had not paſſed the fire; I anſwer'd, they were naked and bare ſolutions of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41152:30"/>the Mineral Ingredients, made without any ſtreſs of fire, and therefore might well be taken to make expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment withall; when he ſeemingly refus'd it, I called for a porrenger of freſh water, and put ſome of each of theſe ſolutions in, taſting it after each diſtinct Ingredient was put in.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Vitriol of Iron made it taſte very like the ſweet <hi>Spaw</hi> at <hi>Knarsbrough;</hi> a little of the ſolution of Nitre and Salt, did not much alter the taſte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; to which a ſolution of Mineral Allom was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which did not yet bring it any thing near the taſte of that <hi>Spaw,</hi> comparing them both together, nor did the addition of Vitriol mend the matter; upon this mixture we poured the ſolution of Gauls, which preſently, upon the account of the ſolution of Allom and Vitriol, became thick and muddy like ink, and became clear from the ſame reaſon, with the addition of ſome drops of the ſpirit of Vitriol; not that the ſolution of Nitre or Salt, contributed any thing to this attrimentous curdling, nor yet was alone from the ſolution of Vitriol, but alſo from the ſolution of Allom, which as to changing colours by the addition of Gauls or ſolution thereof, doth equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer the ſolution of Vitriol.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But to come a little cloſer to the matter, I took a little <hi>Spaw</hi> water in one porrenger, and a little ſolution of the Calx of Allom in another, upon both of which I poured the ſolution of Gauls (made in fair water and filtred) and forthwith both waters, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spaw</hi> water, and the water of Allom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came coloured alike of a deep purple, and from thence (having a little more of ſolution of Gauls added) became blackiſh and opacous almoſt like Ink; by which I demonſtrated to the Doctor, what he would not otherwiſe believe, had not his eyes convinced
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41152:30"/>him, <hi>viz.</hi> that a purple colour, and from thence a dark opacity, like lnk, might he made from another liquor than Vitriol or Iron; to which he ſolely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the changing of colours by a Gaul put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, making that one of his demonſtrations, why Iron is an Ingredient in the <hi>Spaw;</hi> which by an occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler teſtimony I convinced him, that the changing of colour by a Gaul was not any ſufficient evidence, that Iron Vitriol muſt needs be an Ingredient thereof, becauſe the bare ſolution of the Calx of Allom, having nothing of Iron or Vitriol in it, doth give exactly the ſame alteration of colour.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſtrength of his Argument for Iron and Vitriol being plac'd in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſediment which falls to the bottom, upon the alteration with Gauls, which in his book, I take, ſaith he, to be the Iron Mineral with a little touch of the Vitriol; which certainly had been much more proper, if he had ſpoke of the Minera of Iron, and left out Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, or of the Vitriol of Iron, and ſo diſcourſed only of one, for that both ſhould be there, we have in the firſt part denyed, and held inconſiſtent; nor is this variation of colour by Gauls a ſufficient argument of the preſence of the Minera of Iron (though I do not deny it to be an Ingredient) ſeeing a ſolution of the calcin'd ſtone of Allom will do the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But to proceed upon both theſe coloured Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and of the ſolution of Allom by the ſolution of Gauls; I poured a little ſpirit of Vitriol, and preſently by degrees, both of them became alike clear again; the ſpirit of Vitriol working upon, and diſſolving all thoſe ſcattered, looſe confus'd atoms, which the Gaul ſhiver'd the waters into, till they had all become diſſolv'd again in the body of water, and became as clear as at firſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:41152:31"/>8. From whence I inferr'd a further ſimilitude of parts between the <hi>Spaw</hi> water, and the ſolution of Allom, being alike in their precipitation, and in their reduction, to clear Liquors again.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To theſe cleer ſolutions I poured ſome drops of <hi>Oleum Tartari per deliquium,</hi> which cauſed them both to become alike coloured, as deep almoſt as Ink; for this Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> precipitates what ever acid ſpirits, ſuch as ſpirit of Vitriol, of Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> diſſolve, and bring clear ſolutions into confus'd poſtures; by which it appears, that Mineral Bodies or Salts, may by the force of acid <hi>Menſtruums</hi> be reſolv'd into clear Liquors, which Bodies are not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the nature of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and become the ſame with it, as Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> would have Metals that are diſſolv'd in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> to be converted into the nature of the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> whereas lixivial Salts evince the contrary; for either a fixt or volatile Alkali, will preſently precipitate, and make it fall to the bottom; whatever acid corroſive Liquors have diſſolv'd, by which the Metal he thought loſt, would once more become the object of his Opticks.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Then upon theſe Muddy Inky Liquors, I poured ſome more ſpirit of Vitriol, and clear'd them both again, upon which clear Liquors, I poured ſome volatile ſpirit of Harts-horn, which, as the Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> made them both become confus'd and Inky.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. By all which it appeared that the ſolution of calcin'd ſtone of Allom, admitted the ſame preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitations and reſolutions with that of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> by acid Liquors and alkalizate Salts.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Then we poured forth theſe Liquors, and took freſh <hi>Spaw</hi> water, and freſh ſolution of Allom, upon both I poured ſome Oyl of <hi>Tartar per deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41152:31"/>which cauſed a whitiſh curdling ſeparation much-what alike in both, which would again become clear by the addition of ſome drops of the ſpirit or Vitriol.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Now the Query is, how comes Oyl of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> or any lixivial Salt, or volatile ſpirit, to cauſe this ſeparation of parts in all Mineral or Metalline ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are made by acid Menſtruums? Whether they do it by coagulating themſelves upon the bodies of Minerals and Metals, or by uniting with the Salts of the Menſtruums, and ſo thruſting forth the other bodies of Minerals or Metals?</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For the ſolving of which doubt, we muſt firſt know that there are three ſorts of Salts or Spirits, out of which ordiarily Menſtruums are made for the diſſolving of moſt bodies commonly diſſolvable; commonly diſſolvable I ſaid, becauſe the Liquor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaheſt of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> that <hi>primum ens ſalium,</hi> their grand Solvent, doth, as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, diſſolve all ſorts of concretes whatever into their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive juyces. Theſe Salts or Spirits out of which common Menſtruums are made, are either acid, and thoſe either naturally ſo, as the Eſſurine acidity which is to be found in Allom, and Vitriol Stones, alſo in the ſowr juyces of Herbs and Fruits, amongſt which that from Grains or Wines, is moſt eminent; or are ſo made from Mineral Salts by force of fire, as ſpirit of Vitriol, ſpirit of Nitre, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. Or ſecondly, from Alkalizate Salt, and thoſe either fixed (as Salt of Tartar, Wormwood, Broom, or any other vegetable fixed Salt) or vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, as ſpirit of Urine, Blood, Harts-horn, or the like volatile ſpirit from any vegetable, as Sage, Wormwood, and the like; the Alkalizate Salts are uſed to diſſolve in water for the extraction of Braſil, Sena, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the volatile ſpirits mixed with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41152:32"/>ſpirit; helps to procure a ſtronger ſolution and tincture of Mirrh, Aloes and Saffron, than ſpirit of Wine alone would for the making <hi>Elixir Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. Or laſtly, Menſtruums are made from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſpirits, which is the frequent Menſtruum for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the ſubtil ſulphurious Medicinal parts of many vegetables, though I have ſeen and made a fourth ſort of Salt in order to a Menſtruum, which was an artificial one, made by the fire, which indeed is a kind of reſult from the three former Salts or Menſtruums, and being diſſolv'd in water or ſpirit of Wine, makes no ebullition, with either alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate ſolutions or acid ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Now whatever it is that one of the two firſt diſſolves, the other being added precipitates; if any ſolution or extraction be made with alkalizate Salts or volatile Spirits, upon the mixing a little acid ſpirits of Vitriol, Allom, Nitre, or the like, a precipitation is preſently made of the diſſolv'd bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as for inſtance, in the preparation of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery of Chochineel or other vegetables, as the primary Ingredient for the confection of <hi>Alkermes;</hi> which is made by a decoction of the Berries in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, acuated with Oyl of Tartar; when by this means by itterated affuſions of more of the ſame Menſtruum all the tincture is got, upon which filtred pour the ſolution of crude Allom, which is alone as if ſo much ſpirit of Vitriol anſwerable was poured on, and what the lixivial Salts had diſſolv'd, the acid precipitates; which being waſht both from the taſte of Oyl of Tartar and Allom, is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery of <hi>Kermes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. Where take notice that the ingenious <hi>Zuelfer</hi> ſaith, That in the preparation of this <hi>Lacca Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentina,</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41152:32"/>as he calls it, he hath got almoſt double the quantity thereof reſpect of the Berries he firſt took in hand; that which made up the bulk was an addition from the Menſtruum and precipitating Salts.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. So likewiſe in the ſolution of Minerals or Metals, as for inſtance in a filtred ſolution of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol made in fair water, into which if Oyl of Tartar be dropped, there is preſently, as I ſaid before, a ſeparation and precipitation of the Metalline parts of Copper or Iron, according as the Vitriol was made, and with the Colcotarine parts, there doth alſo fall ſome of the very ſalts both of the Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>viz.</hi> acid ſalts (for whoſe ſake it is the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line parts appear under a form of a Liquor) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the alkalizate ſalts, in as much as to make the Colcotar appear, ſingle and ſolitary, there is need of a dulcification by warm water, which being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and evaporated, gives a ſediment or neutral ſalt of the ſame nature with that which is left after the evaporation of the Liquor out of which the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line parts were ſeparated, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Tartarum Vitriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. By which it is evident, that when a Mineral body is diſſolv'd by an Eſſurine acid ſalt, acuating a quantity of water wherein the ſolution is made, fretting upon, and ſubtillizing all the otherwiſe groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer parts of a Mineral <hi>in minima,</hi> grinding them as I may ſay into the minuteſt particles, that then if ſome of the contrary ſort of ſalt, <hi>viz.</hi> fixt or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile alkalies be poured on, the ſalts immediately cloſe with one another; but being of different tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of parts (and thence apt to make different ſorts of Menſtruums) and ſo of a contrary nature one to another, fret themſelves into other ſhapes, in which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41152:33"/>fretting they cauſe an heat, and ſenſible or inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ebullition, according to the intenſeneſs or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs of theſe hoſtile ſalts, in the Duel they thruſt forth the already diſſolved Mineral or Metalline bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which, looſening the ſalts that diſſolv'd them, fall headlong to the bottom, whilſt the ſalts have turn'd themſelves into a <hi>neutrum quid,</hi> and part are faller together with the precipitated body.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. So that the ſalt of Tartar immediately reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the acid ſalts of the Menſtruum that hath diſſolv'd any Mineral body, and thereby precipitates and lets fall to the bottom the diſſolv'd body, and part of it with ſome of the acid ſalts are carryed along with them, which appears becauſe the water wherein the Mineral precipititate body is dulcified upon evapor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gives, as I ſaid before, the ſame things as is made from the combining of the two ſalts in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtagnant water, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum.</hi>

Hence it is that Oyl of Tartar being dropt into the <hi>Spaw</hi> water makes a whitiſh coagulum or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, becauſe of the ſolution of the Minera of Iron, which is diſſolv'd in the Eſſurine acidity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it paſſeth through Allom ſtones or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per matrixes in the bowels of the Earth, wherever its ſound, as to its ſimple primitive elemental acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it's all one, and therefore by ſome called the <hi>primum ens</hi> of all natural Minerals, ſolutions, <hi>Spaw</hi> waters and ſalts.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THus far I aſſented to Dr. WITTIE, <hi>viz.</hi> that an alluminous ſalt, from a Mineral aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity had diſſolved a ſlight touch of the Minera of Iron, and both diſſolv'd in the current ſpring of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter makes up the <hi>Spaw;</hi> I asked him how he would demonſtrate his other three Principles? and firſt as to Vitriol, he ſaid, that in the carriage of the water from the ſpring to remote places, there was found to be a loſs of ſpirits, which he called Vitrioline ſpirits; firſt, that theſe were Vitrioline ſpirits, and that they were loſt, remained to be proved; that there was an alteration in the water by carrying to diſtant places I granted, but that I told him I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41152:34"/>was from a quaſſation of parts, which a wooden veſſels might eaſily admit of an incipient putrefaction, whence might really proceed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of parts, which would beget a great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the texture of the water, not to ſay what alteration may be made from oken veſſels, which by precipitation may make a great alteration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But an ingenious perſon being by, asked the Doctor, whether ſuppoſe the water was ſealed up in a glaſs bottle hermetically, and ſo carryed to a remote place, whether it would be altered by carriage or no? he anſwered, he thought it would; if ſo, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> it was not from any volatility of parts, becauſe the glaſs was ſuppoſed ſealed up, therefore the alteration of the water, was not from the loſs of any volatile ſpirits, and conſequently not from the loſs of the Vitrioline: But the foreſaid ingenious perſon, put ſome of the <hi>Spaw</hi> water into a glaſs bottle, and ſtopt it up from the air; into an other glaſs bottle he alſo put of the ſame water, but let it ſtand open; the firſt he obſerv'd that though it was kept until the water ſuffered a little putrefaction, did yet give a tincture to Gauls; he tryed another bottle after the very ſame maner, which yet did not give the tincture as the other did; but the bottle that ſtood open to the air, within two or three days loſt its tincturing property; ſo that though we ſhould grant there are volatile parts which take wing in the air, yet are they not Vitriol, becauſe though kept in cloſely ſtopt veſſels, yet in time they loſe themſelves, which if a body of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol was there, would be permanent; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an <hi>apporrhea mineralis,</hi> whether Vitrioline or Alluminous.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But being he mentions this loſs of Vitrioline ſpirits, which by agitation of the water (in carrying
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41152:34"/>it at diſtance) evaporates, I wonder ſeeing thoſe are ſo conſiderable according to his own ſuppoſal, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the water act more lively, why, I ſay, in his experimenting the water he did not ſet upon the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, and ſaving, by accurately cloſed joints, thoſe Vitrioline ſpirits, that he might have taſted them, or by other means have brought them upon the teſt and examined their nature; but he very civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they are volatile, lets them go.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you view the Doctors tools, by which he undertakes to hew out the rudiments of this <hi>Spaw,</hi> they are indeed very rude, and of a low rank, <hi>viz.</hi> a skellet, a culinary fire, but not a word of a glaſs Still, which an ingenious Artiſt ſuppoſing volatile ſpirits, would rather have choſen for the ſatisfaction of himſelf and the World, he tells us almoſt a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>viz.</hi> that when the water was almoſt evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and ſpent, it riſeth up in billows making a bubling noiſe, like the boiling of Allom in the Mines at <hi>Whithy,</hi> which he might ſee very frequently in the evaporations of moſt Mineral, Metalline, nay vegetable ſolutions, but that it may be it is the firſt he hath ſeen, and therefore excuſable.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I arguing with him againſt Vitriol, as being inconſiſtent with that of Iron in the <hi>Spaw,</hi> told him that I apprehended, that if there were any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vitriol in it, would be emetick or vomitive; that it had no ſuch operation, conſtant experience convinc'd, as alſo an example he produc'd of a man that every morning drank Eighteen Quarts, for two weeks together without any vomiting at all.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But the reaſon he bluſht not to urge, why, though Vitriol be in the water, yet it ſhould not vomit, you will wonder at, it is this, <hi>viz.</hi> we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently give in our Cordials, ſaith he, ſpirit of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41152:35"/>Vitriol as alſo to quench thirſt, but doth not at all make the Patient vomit, ſaith the Doctor.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As if, according to his account, the ſpirits of Vitriol were nothing elſe but Vitriol it ſelf, and then indeed it would hold good what he ſaith, that when the Vitrioline ſpirits were gone, the Vitriol it ſelf would alſo take wing; to which we return'd, that the ſpirits were but one part or element of Vitriol, and the <hi>caput mortum</hi> or Coltotar another, and that the chief vomitive property, lay not ſingly and diſtinctly in either of theſe, for if the Colcotar ſhould cauſe vomit, yet it is becauſe there remains ſtill ſome ſalts or ſpirits unſeparated, which when throughly dulcified, hath nothing near, if at all, that emetick property it had when the ſalts were joyned to it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Copper amongſt all the Metals, if reſolv'd into a <hi>Viridaeris</hi> or Vitriol by any acid ſalt is the moſt, if not the only emetick Metal (excepting Mercury, which although <hi>mater metallorum,</hi> yet is reckoned one of the ſeven, which by <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> or Oyl of Vitriol, is brought in to precipitate or turbith Mineral, either of which is deſperately eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick) I ſay Copper or the Minera of Copper being reſolv'd by an acidity becomes emetick, theſe ſalts being ſeparated either by diſtillation, or otherwiſe by a Menſtruum, the Metal or Minera becomes what it was again.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now the Quety is, whence the vomitive quality of this cuprous ſolution ſhould proceed? It is not ſurely ſingly from the Sulphur of that Metal, becauſe it being ſeparated from that Metal by the Liquor Alkaheſt, becomes, as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, a ſweet, fixt, anodynous Sulphur, and therefore quite contrary to an emetick property; nor is it alone from the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41152:35"/>Mercurial part, becauſe then the ſame would be had from <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Luna,</hi> &amp;c. inaſmuch as they have as great a proportion, if not a greater of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> than <hi>Venus.</hi> Now the <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> nor the <hi>Sal Jovis,</hi> as far as I underſtand, hath any thing near ſuch, if at all, Emetick qualities; and as for the <hi>Sal Lunae,</hi> or Salt of Silver, that is chiefly purgative, witneſs the <hi>Pillulae Lunares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. It is therefore from the Salts preying both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mercurial and ſulphureous parts jointly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, which together make up ſo hoſtile a texture of parts, as that they become wholly inimical to nature, becoming totally refrectary to the acid ferment of the ſtomach, which not admitting ſo tyrannical an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, gathers all its Forces together, rallies them, and oppoſeth with all its might this grand Antagoniſt.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But reduce again this Vitriol into its primitive Elements, <hi>viz. Sal acidum, &amp; terra Mineralis ſive Colcotar veneris;</hi> or reduce <hi>viride eris</hi> into the acid Salt, and cuprous body, and none of theſe ſingly and alone ſhall be Emetick; for the Spirit of Vinegar, nor ſoure Juyce of Grapes, nor the Spirit of Verdigreeſe, is at all vomitive; nor yet is the Salt of Vitriol of <hi>Venus,</hi> if totally by an artificial <hi>Menſtruum</hi> it be ſeparated, Emetick; nor is the Spirit of the ſame Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol at all vomitive. So that it's very clear, that the hoſtile property of vomiting, is jointly from the commixtion of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that diſſolves either the Minera of Copper, whence the <hi>Vitriolum cupri;</hi> or of that acidity that coagulates upon the very body of Copper, for making of it <hi>viride eris.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. I Queried with the Doctor how he came to underſtand that Nitre was an Ingredient, and that the chief in the <hi>Spaw</hi> water, being as he writes the moſt predominant; his arguments for it were twofold, the firſt argument he urged was this, which as he thought was grounded upon experiment: Take, ſaith he, the <hi>Spaw</hi> water, into which put ſome Gauls, which ſtrikes a colour, then after it hath ſtood awhile, give the veſſel a ſhake, and ſomewhat like a blackiſh ſediment will fall to the bottom, then pour off the clear water, and ſet it upon the fire, and in a little time there will be a ſeparation of a whitiſh curdling matter; take it off the fire, and let it ſtand to cool, and there will be found another whiter precipitation than before, and pour off the clear water again, and this precipitate, ſaith he, taſts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like to Nitre; the clear remaining water being boyled up to a dryneſs give the reſt of the Minerals.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To which I replyed, that after the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation was made, by the addition of Gauls, the the clearly decanted water receiving an alteration from the fire, begun to make a ſpontaneous ſeparation of part of the contents thereof, which I had no other cauſe, from any argument of his, to look upon otherwiſe than of the very ſame nature with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment which remained after the boyling up the reſt of the water, as to the taſte of it, which he thought was ſomewhat Nitrous, I ſuppoſe might be ſpoke in favour of what he would willingly it ſhould have taſted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Many ſolutions may upon the fire give a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of parts, which are yet but of the ſame
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41152:36"/>nature, with thoſe left after the evaporation or diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Liquor, ſo that this whitiſh ſeparation ſevers no diſtinct Ingredient from the <hi>Spaw</hi> water, neither doth it evince any truth in favour of the multiplicity of principles in that water.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His other argument, which indeed is the chief he inſiſts upon, is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt from the Nitre, which is frequently found upon the Cliff, at the bottom whereof the Spring break out, this he thinks muſt needs (becauſe ſo near the Well) contribute its aſſiſtance to the water, and that which confirms him in his judgement, as he imagines, is that when the Rain comes it waſhed off this Nitre, and after that more ſweats thorough the earth, as he ſuppoſeth, and fills the vacancy of the former.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To which we anſwer, that it is true there is Nitre found along the Cliff near the Well, but that this Nitre ſhould contribute any influence to the water, I deny; by ſhewing, firſt, that that Nitre is ingendred chiefly from the air, and next to that, that it is only ſuperficially to be found.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Firſt, that it is chiefly begotten from the air, is apparent becauſe it is to be found very plentifully on old Walls, either Brick or Free ſtone, upon the Lime in the ſeams of the Walls, eſpecially where the Rain comes not, but the air hath free acceſs, for otherwiſe the Rain waſheth it off when it comes; this is called <hi>Nitrum murarium</hi> or <hi>Nitrum aereum,</hi> being a volatile aereal Salt coagulated upon Lime, Allom, Stone, or the Mineral Earth of Allom.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To the coagulation of which Salt, is required a competent body or ſubject, which may anſwer the indication of a <hi>Magnet,</hi> upon which theſe Nitrous particles, floting in the air, ſettle themſelves; of which ſort are the forenamed bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> Lime,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41152:37"/>Allom, Stone, Mineral Earth of the ſame, as alſo any fixed ſalt, penetrating the body of an earthen Pot, as likewiſe an Eſſurine Colcotar, made barren of its imbred ſpirits by force of fire, all which cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre upon themſelves, the volatile Nitrous Atoms diſperſed in the air.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. So that this Nitre lyeth not in veins of the earth as a Mineral ſalt, as Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> ſuppoſeth, but is meerly ſuperficial, and therefore waſhed away by every daſh of Rain; for if a ſolution were made of the ſame Mineral earth where this is found, it is very probable we ſhould upon examination find nothing of Nitre in it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The other part of his argument, which he thinks is <hi>inſtar omnium,</hi> to confirm his opinion of Nitre the chief Ingredient, is this experiment, <hi>viz.</hi> that upon the expoſing of the Minerals (as he calls the ſediment left after evaporation of the water) ſome while in a moiſt and cold air, that there have been found <hi>ſtiries</hi> or little Icikles among them, which is the form of Nitre; as to the veracity of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment we are not incredulous, but that this ſhould evince the preexiſtence of Nitre in that ſediment, is the thing we contend and very much queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For we ſay that the alluminous body left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, after evaporation of the water, is of the ſame nature with the Mineral earth or ſtone of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom found upon the Cliff, and ſo the one as well as the other becomes equall magnetical, and attract or centre upon themſelves the floting Nitrous parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles diſperſed abroad in the air; ſo that it is not the moiſt air that extraverts any preexiſtent nitrous parts from the body of the minerals; but the vollatile nitrous ſalt fluctuating in the air, ſettles it ſelf upon proper magnetical bodies, among which, the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41152:37"/>of the <hi>Spaw</hi> water (being chiefly an Allumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Salt) is moſt peculiar.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. BUt that we may the better illuſtrate the truth of what we aſſert, <hi>viz.</hi> That an acid alumeniſh mineral Salt, preying upon, and diſſolving a ſlight touch of the Minera of Iron, gives eſſence to this <hi>Spaw,</hi> conſider this following Experiment. Take a duskiſh yellow Earth, which lyeth much in veins, as alſo interſperſedly here and there upon the Cliff near the Well, which is diſcernable enough in taſte, being ſweet and ſtiptick, like Vitriol, or Allom, or both.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This I diſſolv'd in ſimple diſtill'd Water, and filtred, with which mixing a little powder of Gauls, gave an alteration of colour towards a purple, though not ſpeedily, which with Spirit of Vitriol became clear again, after the manner of the <hi>Spaw</hi> water.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſame clear Solution of this Minera found upon the Bank under which the <hi>Spaw</hi> runs, being mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Oyl of Tartar, gives a white <hi>Coagulum</hi> of milky ſeparation, like the water of the <hi>Spaw</hi> it ſelf, or the ſolution of Allom; which, with addition of Spirit of Vitriol, or <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> becomes clear, and with Oyl of Tartar becomes white, which may be again reſtored to its priſtine Clarity, by adding Spirit of Vitriol, or <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fame Solution having ſome drops of Spirit of Harts-horn mixed therewith, gives a white ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with Spirit of Salt becomes clear again, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable in every particular to the <hi>Spaw</hi> water it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Some of this clear Solution I diſtill'd in a Glaſs retort, until what remained was a bright ſtyriate flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcule,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41152:38"/>increaſing the fire ſomewhat more, it came to be a dry white Salt, of a ſtiptick allumenous taſte.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The water which was diſtill'd off from this Salt, being ſaved in a glaſs Receiver, whoſe joints was cloſe ſtopped, would not give any alteration of colour, either with ſolution of Gauls, or with lix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ivium of Tartar; which argued that no heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous volatile parts of the ſame nature with the Salts, came over the helm.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. All which put together, evince no leſs than a parity or likeneſs of Principles between that Mineral earth, and the <hi>Spaw</hi> water; for from a parity of Principles in an homogeneal proceſs, reſults a likeneſs of products, ſo that the <hi>Spaw</hi> is nothing elſe but this Eſſurine acid Salt in its Mineral earth <hi>(in toro ſuo Metallico)</hi> being an allumeniſh terreſtrial Globe, diſſolv'd in the current Spring of water.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For the ſpecifical difference of all Mineral Salts, depend upon theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sulphurious, acid, eſſurine ſpirit; water, and a Mineral Glebe; from the various ſolutions and mixtures of which, ariſe the variety of Mineral Salts, in the bowels of the earth.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Water impregnate with this acid ſulphurious ſpirit, diffus'd thorough the occult Meanders of the terraqueous Globe, according to the nature of the Mineral Glebe it meets withal, it becomes coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into ſuch and ſuch a ſalt; for if this acidulated water, find a ſalſuginous Glebe, it becomes coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, according to the property of that Glebe, together with its connate ſalt in a <hi>ſal marine,</hi> which with greater daſhes of water paſſing thorough the ſubterraneal channels, becomes diſſolv'd and carryed into the Ocean, thence the ſaltneſs of the Sea, which hath its Minera from foſſile ſalt, from which alſo
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41152:38"/>ſome Springs are fatturate, as the Sulphur Well at <hi>Knarſbrough, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. If the ſuphurious acidulate water meet with Nitrous Veins, it coagulates into Nitre, which being by other current ſtreams of water diſſolv'd, very probably become the original of intenſely cold ſprings, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as <hi>Magnus</hi> Well, <hi>Cockroft</hi> Well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which though to touch extremely cold, yet by an intrinſick ſulphurious warming property, doth ſo notably open the pores of ſuch as are bathed therein, as that it reſolves the congealed blood and latex, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled about the joints and outward parts of the body, thence becoming the cauſe of Pains, Aches, Stiffneſs, Numbneſs and Lameneſs of the joints, which by the penetrating opening virtue of thoſe Nitrous ſprings are reſolv'd, and thence a redintegration of the glyſſent ferments of the blood and humours, which give warmth and motion to all the parts again.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. If the aforeſaid eſſurine water find a Mineral Iron bed, it becomes determin'd thereby, either into a Vitriol, or becomes the original of moſt acid <hi>Spaws,</hi> called <hi>Fontes aciduli,</hi> ſharp ſprings, ſuch as <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, Epſom, Knarſbrough, &amp;c.</hi> amongſt which this of <hi>Scarbrough</hi> is not the leaſt.</p>
                  <p n="12">12.

                  <p n="13">13. As the Minera of Iron terminates the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious acidity into vitrioline ſharp ſprings, ſo in like manner the Minera or <hi>primum ens</hi> of Copper, coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates this eſſurine ſalt into a cuprous Vitriol, and that either foſſile to be digged out of Mines, or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For in theſe the Metals are <hi>in ſolutis principiis,</hi> in their primitive juyces; their Mercuries, though volatile, crude, and undigeſted, yet are ſpermatical and as ſuch are the radical moiſture of Metals, not to ſay the Mercury of Philoſophers; theſe are apt to be coagulated and maturated into Metals, by the embryonate Sulphurs, which lurk <hi>in intimis Thalamis glebarum metallicarum,</hi> which according to the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41152:39"/>purity or impurity of the terreſtrial Matrix, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the graduation of the Sulphurs, are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and ſpecificated in imperfect and perfect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals to the completing the ſeptenary of the Metallick order, beſides their middle Minerals, which are in the Road to Metalization.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That all Metals and Minerals have their innate ſeeds, ſhut up in themſelves, we ſhall not need to ſpend time to confirm, <hi>in auro ſemina ſunt auri quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis abſtruſas recedunt longius;</hi> ſeeing that their ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick principles, become prolifick <hi>ſuo more;</hi> whoſe ſeed operating in a volatile crude Mercury, and an embrionate Sulphur, become deducible after the manner of a natural geneſis unto their ſtate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation, accord to the proceſs of their concretes in the Vegetable kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We may therefore conſider, that as God, the original Founder of all beings, hath implanted in the ſuperficies of the earth, that great variety of vegetable ſeeds, whence the diverſity of Plants, not only ſprung up at firſt, but by their ſeminal begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or ſomewhat analogous thereto, have continued to propagate themſelves in their ſpecies.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Every Vegetable at its proper ſeaſon by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the heavenly influences, having its ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals ſet at work, in which it hath its own ſpecifick faber, or (if I may ſo call it) Archeus, which by its innate plaſtick power, begins to hew forth it ſelf a body, out of the elementary principle of water, ſhaping it ſelf in ſtalk, branches, leaves, flowers, ſeeds and fruits, according to the platform laid in the ſeminal beginings thereof, every Plant in its kind, to the great and wonderful variety, which we ſee upon the face of the earth, ſo that <hi>preſentem refert, qualibet herba Deum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41152:40"/>6. So in like manner the inviſible Divine Power, hath according to his own <hi>beneplacit,</hi> diſperſed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Mineral and Metaline ſeeds in hidden pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the opake body of the earth, whence indeed the great and manifold difference of Mineral Glebes or Earths, which Mineral ſeeds, as well as all others, whether vegetable or animal, are indemonſtrable <hi>a priori,</hi> taking at firſt their immediate beginings from the very boſom of the Eternal Being.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And therefore only demonſtrable to us <hi>à poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori, viz.</hi> to our common ſenſe, by appearing in a viſible garb upon the Stage of the World. Now theſe diſperſed Mineral Seminaries, wherewith ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parcels of earth become impregnate, being ſet at work by the primitive <hi>fiat,</hi> which is the ſame to this day as ever, in their begining to ſhape bodies for their ideal eſſences to become manifeſt in, form to themſelves a Mercurial volatile juyce, and an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brionate Sulphur, as the <hi>materia proxima &amp; prima</hi> to Metalization.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. With theſe two proximate principles, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Archeal faber operates, ripens the elemental crudities, and in a linear proceſs puts on a tincture and weight, and at length terminates in the coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a perfect Metal, ſpecificated according to the form of the innate ſeed; for the ripening coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating fire of the embrionate Sulphur, is as the <hi>Solterrae (id quod eſt inferius, eſt ſicut quod eſt ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius)</hi> which kills the <hi>Python, viz.</hi> exiccates and maturates the radical Mercurial moiſture, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates it in a Metalick ſpecies: But I digreſs, this being more fit for a Philoſophick diſcourſe upon another ſubject.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We ſay therefore that theſe Mineral Glebes, have for the moſtpart a Mercury and a Sulphur <hi>in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41152:40"/>ſolutis principiis,</hi> and both diſſolvable in an eſſurine ſalt for ſalts are the keys that unlock the Mineral Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are thoſe Menſtrual Salts which teach Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Metals how to diſſolve in water, by breaking them <hi>in minima,</hi> and thereby how to communicate their medicinal virtues for the health of mans body.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Here the Chymiſtry of nature is moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which by its own peculiar Menſtruums ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the eſſential innate virtues of Mineral Glebes, and that by an intrinſick inviſible fire in the digeſting veſſels of the earth, yea and by the help of Art, ſupplying the difficulties of Nature, by frequent ſolutions and coagulations, may yet further graduate theſe mineral virtues into more noble Arcana's, whoſe eſſential tinctures may the better penetrate the vital ferments of the Microcoſm.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But how this Sulphurious eſſurine Salt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes determined and ſpecificated, according to the difference of the Mineral Glebes it meets with, into this or that foſſile Salt or Mineral mixture, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not unaptly be repreſented, by this following inſtance; as ſuppoſe ſeveral colours and ſalts placed at a diſtance, one from another upon a large Marble, and common ſimple water is convey'd to each of theſe, this water though the ſame to all, yet as it comes to every of them, it becomes differently tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and taſted, according to the colour and taſte of thoſe parcels it meets with.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. So this eſſurine Sulphurous Spirit, meeting with variety of Mineral Earths, though the ſame in it ſelf to every one, yet becomes altered and tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the different property of the Mineral Earth, and that according to the degree of Sulphur, maturating the crude Mercurial juyce.</p>
                  <p>Now to confirm this our Theſis, we muſt aſſume
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41152:41"/>theſe two conſiderations, firſt, that all the various ſpecificated Mineral Salts, as Allom, Vicriol, Nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have <hi>aliquid commune,</hi> ſomething in common amongſt themſelves; and ſecondly, that thereby all theſe Salts become tranſmutable one into another.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For the firſt, that they have ſomething in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among themſelves, beſides confirmation by our previous diſcourſe, is yet further demonſtrable by matter of fact upon our ſecond conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> the tranſmutability of one ſalt into another, by the Chymical Art we can out of <hi>ſal marine</hi> or the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thereof make a Vitriol of Iron or Copper, and by diſſolving Quickſilver in Oyl of Vitriol, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is done in making turbith Mineral; as ſuppoſe four Ounces of Oyl of Vitriol to one of Mercury, after the phlegm is evaporated and diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that there remains a white precipitate, which edulcorated by waſhing gives a Citrine powder, and being revived (as by diſtilling it from pot-aſhes it may) gives the ſame weight of current Quickſilver as it was at firſt: This water which is impregnate with the Vitrioline Salts, by being boyled up gives a true Allom; here Vitriol ſalts are tranſmuted into an allumeniſh ſalt, and that without the addition of any thing but Quickſilver, which is again totally ſeparable, and yet ſalts by the very odour of the Mercury is turn'd into an Allom.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And not only Oyl of Vitriol with Mercury, but alſo Oyl of Vitriol with common <hi>ſal marine</hi> gives Alumen; for if you put Oyl of Vitriol, as we ſometimes have done upon common ſalt, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil it in a glaſs body or retort, with a gentle heat, you will find a very volatile ſpirit of ſalt will come over the helm, which will fume exceedingly, the <hi>caput mort',</hi> or remaining ſalt being diſſolved, gives a ſalt exactly reſembling Allom.</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41152:41"/>15. Alſo Allom in its Minera expoſed to the air, is as a Magnet to Nitre, attracting and centring it upon it ſelf, and common ſalt is in the body of Nitre. Thus you ſee a relation or circulation of ſalts one into another; and all this, becauſe they have in their Centre that one common Eſſurine ſpirit of ſalt, which according to various alterations in Mineral beds ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of different coagulations.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. In ſhort, by way of recapitulation, it is thus, the Eſſurine acid ſalt, having in its ſolution got a ſlight touch of a Vein or Minera of Iron, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through a Rocky Mineral Glebe of Allom (of which along the ſhore of <hi>Scarbrough</hi> and <hi>Whithy</hi> is found great plenty) becomes more ſpecificated in an allumenous than any other ſalt, with which the water of the Quick-ſpring (which breaks forth at the foot of the Rock) is impregnate, which makes that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spaw,</hi> we diſcourſe of.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="section">
                  <head>SECT 7.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. HAving thus run through the eſſential princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this ſpring, which make up this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Mineral water, which is ſo frequently (and that for the moſt part, not without the expected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs) drunk for the health of mens bodies, I think it not impertinent to ſpeak ſomewhat of its virtues, and that the rather becauſe Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> gave forth, as I was inform'd, that I endevoured to defame the <hi>Spaw,</hi> in that I held it to be an allumenous Spring.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let him therefore and the World know, that in the Eſſurine ſalt of Allom, as noble medicinal virtues are to be found, as in any other Mineral ſpecificated ſalt whatever, for this ſalt in its <hi>primum
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41152:42"/>ens</hi> is volatile, and therefore exquiſitly penetrative, forcing its paſſage, thorough the otherwiſe obſtructed Meanders of the bowels, notably opening the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the parts, and thereby reſtoring the blood, and other peculiar ſpirituous juyces of the <hi>genus nervoſum,</hi> to their primitive fermental vigor.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the better underſtanding of which, we are to conſider, firſt, the natural fermental digeſtions of the body; next to that the depravations thereof, by excrementitious parts; and thirdly the Diſeaſes thence depending; and laſtly, the reſtoration of theſe digeſtions, by removing the interrupting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles and redintegration of the blood and humours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Firſt by the digeſtive ferments of the body, I mean ſuch alterative juyces as are <hi>ab origine</hi> implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſuch various principal parts, as are adapted for the tranſmuting of the nutritive juyce of all ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from one conſiſtence, colour, and taſte, into another, untill it hath run the whole circuit of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, giving a proportionable nouriſhment to every part, for growth of children in the way to maturity, and for the ſupplying the deficiences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by conſtant tranſpiration in adult perſons.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe ferments are (as the ingenious <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith) <hi>tranſmutationum parentes &amp; à priori inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrabiles,</hi> the authors of all tranſmutations, and cannot be demonſtrated by any thing before them, becauſe they are primitively inſerted <hi>ab ortu,</hi> and ſo become radical principles.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That of the ſtomach is certainly ſuch a one as is ſcarſely to be parallel'd <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the prodigious effects <hi>Helmont</hi> tells us of the grand Liquor Alkaheſt, which makes every concrete <hi>fatiſcere in ſuam primam materiam,</hi> reſolving them into their primitive juyces. This acid ferment of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41152:42"/>the ſtomach is ſo powerful, as no other extraneous acidity in the World, can (if in its native vigor) reſolve the hardeſt of aliments into a milky juyce, and tranſmute ſeveral ſorts of food, as Beef, Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Veal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taken at the ſame time into one ſimilar <hi>cremor,</hi> which no other acidity (we yet know of) can do, though aſſiſted by as equal a dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive heat, as we can imagine to be in the ſtomach or the parts adjacent.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I ſhall not enter upon a large diſcourſe of the Ferments, being notably and fully diſcuſs'd, both by the noble <hi>Helmont,</hi> and the ingenious Dr. <hi>Willis;</hi> I ſhall only aſſume ſo much of that Doctrine as to illuſtrate what I intend, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe vital ferments being ſtrong and vigorous make ſuch alterations, ſeparations, depurations, exaltations and aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the nutritive juyce, as are convenient for health and the common functions of life.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But if they become alienated and depraved, by excrementitious parts, accumulated through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities of living, as by exceſs of meats or drinks, which burden by out-proportioning the digeſtions, as alſo by food which agrees not with the ferment of the ſtomach, as alſo by unſeaſonable exerciſes, and by paſſions of the mind; all which together with the inclemency of the air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have ſuch an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon this and other parts of the body, as that by perverting the ferment, or precipitating the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented maſs, doth ſo alter the function thereof, as that thereby no ſmall foundation is laid for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Diſeaſes, both acute and chronical; but eſpecially chronical, whoſe deep roots are moſt what inſerted in the ſeminals of the depraved ferment of the ſtomach.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Diſeaſes thence proceeding, are generally
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41152:43"/>the Scurvy, Dropſie, Aſthma, Vertigo, Nauſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, Vomitings, Diarchea's, and ſometimes Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which, though when in their full ſtate of ſymptomes and products, indicate a vitiating of other ferments of the body, and appear in other parts, yet have their beginings from the perverſions of the ſtomachical ferment.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For no ſooner is the ferment of the ſtomach vitiated, by the foreſaid or any other occaſional cauſe, but the nutritive juyce receives ſuch different alterations (according to the degree of the error of the ferment) from what it ſhould be, as that either the crudeneſs or over acidneſs of the chile whilſt yet in the ſtomach, lays the begining of the ſeminaries of the foreſaid Diſeaſes, which being tranſmitted thus raw, or too pontick into the other digeſtions, draw them likewiſe into conſent, and ſo vitiate one digeſtion after another, until the Diſeaſes appear in their full dimenſion and latitude of ſymptomes.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Now if the ferments become debilitated by the accumulation of excremental impurities, which in perſons of weak conſtitutions in tract of time, more eaſily happen, than the alimental juyce proves not well diſſolved and digeſted, which paſſing the firſt digeſtion thus crude, either before its tranſit through the <hi>pilorus,</hi> cauſeth a <hi>flatus,</hi> then a Nauſeating Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting or Pain of the Stomach, a Vertigo, or lays the foundation of a Feaver, either continual or intermitting; if it paſs the <hi>pilorus,</hi> it vitiates the ſecond digeſtion in the inteſtines, and thence Worms, Jaundice, Obſtructions of the Miſentery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. If this vitiated juyce paſs thus uncorrected from the thoraeical veſſels, into the <hi>vena cava,</hi> and ſo into the heart, which I ſuppoſe to be the third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, taking the ſecond and third of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41152:43"/>digeſtions to be but one, which is done in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines and lacteal veſſels: The third, to begin with ſanguification, <hi>viz.</hi> when the chyle hath paſſed the ſecond digeſtion in the inteſtines, and there receives a further depuration and ſeparation into a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined milky juyce, whoſe receptacle are the <hi>glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> of the Meſentery, and the <hi>Lumbazes</hi> is further carryed by the thoracical veſſels into the jugular veins, and there meeting with the blood, is daſht with a rubicund colour, and carryed into the ventricles of the heart, and there undergoes the third ferment, where it is elaborated into vital blood. I ſay if the foreſaid vitiated juyce, come thus raw into this third digeſtion it terminates in Fevers both continual and intermittent.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For the (otherwiſe) nutritive juyce, coming ſo indigeſted to the vital ferment of the heart, which is not able to maſter it, or make any good arterial blood, ſubverts the vital digeſtion thereof, rouſeth up a ſpurious febrile fermentation, and inteſtine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the blood; hence the burning heat in Fevers, and coming from an impure digeſtion in the ſtomach, whoſe footſteps it yet retains, thence the great thirſt, and from the ſame, yet further vitiating the other digeſtions of the <hi>genus nervoſum</hi> (which is the Minera of animal Spirits) proceeds Frenzies, Deliriums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of this vitiated juyce, and conſequenly of the intenſe or remiſs diſturbance of this vital ferment it cauſeth the paroxyſmes of intermiting Fevers, to come ſooner and later, thence the variety of Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian, Tertian, double Tertian, Quartan Agues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. If this depraved juyce arrive at the <hi>ſuccus nervoſus, ubi ſpiritus animales cuduntur,</hi> which I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41152:44"/>take to be the fourth digeſtion, or depuration of nutritive juyce, in its road to abſolving the function of ſenſe and motion; thence a perturbation of thoſe animal Spirits, an inverſion of their natural <hi>craſis,</hi> whence Lethargies, Epilepſies, Apoplexies, Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Spaſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which depend upon the deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpermatick juyce of the <hi>genus nervoſum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. But if it reach to, or be depraved, by the fifth or laſt digeſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> the aſſimilative ferment of the ſolid parts of the body: thence Abſceſſus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumations, Fiſtula's, Ulcers, Tumors, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which depend upon the vitiating of the ultimate digeſtion in the habit of the body.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. I look upon the alimental juyce in its way to nutrition, to undergoe many alterations from ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical ferments, placed in different parts of the body; to ſuffer many ſeparations, and to paſs through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Colanders or Streiners, where it is percolated and depurated, each ferment after other (while a ſymmetrie in the occonomy of parts) inricheth it with new and more balſamick tinctures, enlivens it with more elaborate ſpirituous particles, adapted for the clarity of ſenſual functions, as a more depurate diaphanous vehicle for the ſoul to act in.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. I ſay theſe Spirits (which are almoſt the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate reſult of all the digeſtions) have their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and daily ſupply, from the ſucculent parts of the aliment, which paſſeth various fermentations, and are at laſt fabricated out of the pureſt parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; according therefore as the vigour of theſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, and the depurations of the nutritive juyce more or leſs: ſo are theſe Spirits in their Craſis more pure and ſerene, or dull and opake, whence the ſoul which ſees and acts by theſe organical Spirits, either becomes lightſome and cheerful in the outward fancy
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41152:44"/>and portals of the external ſenſes; thence the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine and colerick complexion. Or becomes dark, dull, and heavy, and as it were incarcerated in the dungeons of the ſenſes and ſenſual fancy, the clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of thoſe Spirits darkens the ſoul, and makes up the melancholy complexion, which with a little variation makes the phlegmatick.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. I look upon the Spleen and the ferment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to contribute very much to the Craſis of theſe Spirits; for if the ferment thereof be deprav'd, ſo as a due ſeparation of the blood is not made (which yet ought to be) and that which ſhould be ſeparated is yet retained: thence obſtructions in the very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchym of that bowel, a darkning and cloudineſs of the Spirits, a melancholy vaporous ſteam ſoyls the channels of the animal Spirits, and obſcures the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe nimble agents, inverts their order, breaks their ranks, and brings a ſad cataſtrophe upon the animal powers.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. The ſoul while in the body hath theſe airy Spirits for its Vehicle, having thereby an influence upon all and every part, is not determined to any particular place, neither in the <hi>glandula pinealis</hi> of the brain according to <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> nor yet in the membranous tunicles of the ſtomach, according to <hi>Helmont;</hi> though I do not deny but in the one it may have its peculiar reſiding place for the regulating the culinary digeſtions, and in the other its turret to take in the ſenſible impreſſions from outward objects, to look about it through the caſements of the ſenſes, yet is eſſentially in every part: and where ever it finds any hoſtile enemy, which impugneth the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe Spirits, there the ſenſitive ſoul (by which I mean the vital and animal Spirits, which yet are but one; and that the Vehicle of the immortal
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41152:45"/>Soul) acts <hi>ad nutum,</hi> rallies up all its forces, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters the Diſeaſe, and at length, <hi>ſi vires ferent,</hi> plucks out the morbid thorn, and all is well again.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. So that all the digeſtions and ferments, the ſeparations and depurations thereunto belonging, are but to prepare and ſo elaborate the nutritive juyce, as thence a continual ſupply may come in for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of theſe animal Spirits, the Vehicle of the ſoul; whoſe different Craſes make different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions; and whoſe different alterations, by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous depravations of intermediate ferments, cauſe no ſmall off ſpring of Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Now as the crudity of the alimental juyce, firſt made ſo, for want of a due fermentation in the ſtomach, and paſſing on uncorrected from one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion to another, lays the foundation (as I ſaid) of ſeveral Diſeaſes: ſo in like manner the over acid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſpurious ponticity of the ſtomachical ferment (which is alſo a depravation of the ferment thereof) gives begining to ſeveral other Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. For though the genuine ferment of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, be ſpecifically acid; and as ſuch, doth ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, diſſolve and equally mix the meat and drink we take, as to bring it to a chyliferous cremor, and that as a neceſſary preparation to the ſucceeding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions: yet if it become too exorbitant, even while in the ſtomach working up to the upper mouth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, cauſeth Cardialgia's, Heart-burnings, and ſowr belchings. That a ſpurious acidity is the cauſe thereof, appears by their Cure, which is done by ſuch things as have power to correct, by diluting and ſweetning ſuch ſuperfluous acidities, <hi>viz.</hi> by any fixed ſalt of Vegetables, or any concretes which contein a fixt Alkali in them, as Crabs Eyes, Corals, Pearl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. This ſpurious acidity tranſmitted into other
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41152:45"/>digeſtions, cauſe other Diſeaſes, <hi>extra ſuos lares,</hi> ſaith <hi>Helmont, in alienam meſſem tranſmiſſa, evadit hoſtile venis &amp; arteris, &amp;c.</hi> for if it be ſent into the ſecond digeſtion, it cauſeth ſometimes the Colick, Gripings, Iliack Paſſion, with Spaſms, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motions of the Guts: and ſometimes from an acid <hi>flatus</hi> or ſowriſh <hi>gas,</hi> fretting upon the ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick parts of the inteſtines, cauſeth Gripings, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteries, which grating upon the tender tunicles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, liquates the blood from them, and the adjacent parts; at every tormenting liquation puts nature upon the rack, makes the tender parts confeſs their weakneſs to ſo powerful a fretting agent.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Where by the way take notice, that in a complete digeſtion of the ſtomach, where there is no more than a proportionable acidity, the cremor comes ſomewhat acidulate to the ſecond digeſtion, which by the ferment of thoſe parts, is tranſmuted into another taſte, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of a ſaline taſte, I ſay though it come ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what acidulate, yet is conquerable by the ferment of the next digeſtion; ſo that unleſs the acidity be beyond the natural proportion, it cauſeth no alteration as to the foreſaid Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. If this exorbitant acidity be carryed to the third digeſtion in the heart, it becomes hoſtile to the arteries, ſubverts the Craſis of the blood, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the ſweet balſamick ſoft natural temper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, impreſſing an auſtere ſowre property: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſeth Fevers, but moſtwhat lays the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a depraved ſcorbutick ferment, by perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſweet temperature of the blood, inclining it to a ſowr ſaltiſhneſs, which precipitating the balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick parts, and giving fluidity to the ſaltiſh and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous parts of the blood, in the ſame ſowriſh
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41152:46"/>property, hinders the natural fermentation of the blood, and in lieu thereof begets this ſcorbutick fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. This pervertion of the genuine ferment of the blood, proves a remora to its circulation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it at ſometimes to reſtagnate, in ſome of the arterial or venal chanels in ſome parts of the body: where coagulating, cauſeth Tumours, Impoſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, inward Ulcers, Pains, becomes a thorn in thoſe parts, which pricketh (if I may ſo ſay) the Archeus, incenſeth the Spirits, inflames the parts, brings on a Fever, which, if mortal, hurries all out of doors.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. The ſcorbutick ferment prevailing, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſpreads it ſelf, by vitiating one digeſtion after another, until it appear clad in all its colours, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth in all its ſymptomes and products, which are various, ſometimes in one dreſs, ſometimes in another, <hi>viz.</hi> in erratick Pains, Dulneſs and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs of Spirits, Tumors, Ulcers of many ſorts, Spots, Looſeneſs of the Teeth, Soreneſs of the Gooms, Foulneſs of the skin by Botches, Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and other impurities of the outward parts.</p>
                  <p>For the blood is ſo corrupted by the vitiating fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scurvy, as that it conſtantly breaths forth, ſtaining Apporrhea's or impure ſteams, which making their egreſs through the pores of the skin, are, by obſtructions they find there, coagulated upon the outward parts, and ſo make Spots, Botches, Foulneſs, Roughneſs (as if nettled) and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities of the skin.</p>
                  <p>I cannot otherwiſe, at leaſt not better, compare the skin of mans body, in theſe and ſuch like foul Diſeaſes, than to a tranſparent glaſs; which if the ſteams, riſing from a ſpurious fermentation of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41152:46"/>blood and humours, become too groſs to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the pores thereof, then they condenſe along the ſides, begeting Spots, Stains, foul Damps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> analogical to the dampy miſts of the Scurvy, which if it were poſſible to cover the body over with tranſparent, white glaſs, we might eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the impure miſts and dark ſteams, ariſing from the baſtardly fermentation of the blood, in Scurvies, venereal Diſeaſes, malignant Fevers, Plague, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which if the interception of the circulation of the air (that neceſſary bellows of Life) would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſucceſsfulneſs of the experiment of glaſs-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, we might diſcern very ſtrange and unthought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Apporrhea's, cloudy miſts, impure ſteams, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate within the atmoſphere of the aforeſaid diſeaſed bodies, perhaps not much unlike thoſe foggy miſts, cloudy vapours, and tempeſtuous confuſions, which frequently happen within the Orb of the Earths at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, which gives that frequent change of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Macrocoſm, as theſe cauſe alterations in the Microcoſm.</p>
                  <p>Theſe vaporous ſteams ariſing from the blood of perſons infected with the foreſaid Diſeaſes, are not ſimple diſtillations, or meer evaporations of the blood; for then neither our glaſs-Receivers, or our skins would condenſe or percolate any other than fair ſimple water, which would cauſe neither Spots nor Stains: but the ſteams of ſpurious fermenting blood is quite otherwiſe; for here nature endevours an analyſis of the morbid matter, in the reſolution whereof, it carrys of <hi>vapore tenus,</hi> the very ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miaſmes, equivolent (according to their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to the relicts thereof, ſtrugling in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of the blood; for we ſee in all fermentations a ſeparation of ſome <hi>terrene faeces</hi> to the ſides of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41152:47"/>veſſels, alſo of an incoercible <hi>flatus,</hi> which carries along with it ſome ſlight touches of the radical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the fermenting Liquor.</p>
                  <p>Whence firſt we ſee the reaſon of the infectiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the foreſaid Diſeaſes; for in ſuch ſpurious fermentations nature attempts a reſolution and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the peccant matter, which takes wing by thoſe impure vaporous ſteams; in its road it leaves its character of Spots, Stains, Blotches, Buboes, Ulcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the outward parts of the skin, and ſo goes on to the utmoſt extent of the activity of its own Orb, which if (as I ſaid) could be retained by glaſs-Receivers, we ſhould not only ſee the extent of its Orb, but alſo view the corrupting ſoiling Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porrhea's, which iſſue from ſuch infected bodies; now what bodies come within the orb of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, if duly fitted for the reception of thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmes, they become tainted with effluvia's thereof, which retain the platform of the very ſeminal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Diſeaſe in the body, or at leaſt carry along with them ſomewhat analogical to thoſe very Diſeaſes they ſpring from, even ſo much as to be ſufficient to propagate the like Diſeaſe in the next infected body, as we ſee moſt frequently in malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Fevers; eſpecially the Plague.</p>
                  <p>Whence alſo we ſee the reaſon why ſome precious ſtones, worn in Rings or otherwiſe, <hi>per modum appenſorum,</hi> will ſuffer a loſs in their oriental ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and brightneſs, when near ſuch bodies as have theſe ſoyling ſteams ariſe from their fermental impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſuch bodies as have the Small Pox, malignant Fevers, Plague, yea ſometimes in ſuch as have the <hi>French</hi> Diſeaſe and Scurvy in an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, whence the Saphir or the Hyacinth, being ſo held to a pained Member in ſuſpicion of the Plague,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41152:47"/>as that it reflects the light upon the affected part, doth ſo collect and concentre thoſe malignant ſteams which ariſe from the infected blood, as that in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall time (if the party be really infected) it makes the part grow wan and black, and becomes the inſallible indication of the Plague, by which afterward, as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, the virulency as through a tube or chimney is driven forth; that a piece of red Coral ſhould grow pale upon the touching of an hyſterical (or I rather think menſtrual) woman is from the ſame cauſe; for upon the regurgitation of the menſtrues there happens an extrordinary defedation of the blood, which by a kind of viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fermentation, ſets the blood into a venemous ſteaming; which oftentimes is ſo powerful, as it not only ſoils the external parts, but alſo paſſeth forth, and meeting with any trannſparent or reflecting glaſs, or Gem ſtains them, which is not ſo much from the breath of a menſtruous woman, as from other ſteams which paſs through the pores of the body round, but eſpecially at the portals of the eyes.</p>
                  <p>In like manner appears the reaſon of the <hi>Eveſtrum vitae, bene vel male affectae;</hi> for amongſt precious ſtones, ſome are diaphanous, others opake, as Coral, Cornelian, Turcois, Jaſpis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in pellucids, as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Eveſtrumvitae</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberates it ſelf; for as he ſaith, <hi>gaudet vitaſpeculo lucido reflecti,</hi> and therefore he looks upon Gems as opake well poliſhed glaſſes.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing as he further ſaith, that ſomething doth conſtantly and neceſſarily breath through the pores of our bodies, which participates with life it ſelf, and acts within the ſphere of its orb; and this in the moſt ſound bodies, which if it find a polite body, reflects it ſelf therein in the manner of a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41152:48"/>glaſs; and hence it is that many periapta become effectual, by being ſuch polite bodies, wherein the <hi>eveſtrum vitae</hi> reflects it ſelf <hi>in modum ſpeculi;</hi> and from this very root ariſeth moſt of the <hi>arcana ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetica;</hi> yea and from this original by ſigmental ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions came the <hi>Ganiahen</hi> and <hi>Talis manica</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> from whom <hi>Paracelſus</hi> was taught that ſort of Magical Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Archidoxis Magiea, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. This <hi>Dyſeraſia ſanguinis</hi> is not only compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to the Scurvy, but alſo to other chronick Diſeaſes, as the Quartan Ague and the Dropſie, in both which, the peculiar natural ferment of the blood is much vitiated; in the firſt of which, the blood loſing its native balſamick ſweetneſs, becomes acid and pontick, even in an high meaſure; thence the great difficulty of its redintegration to its former eucraſia: in the latter, the blood becomes too much diluted, drowning its rubicund balſamick tincture, in a watery deluge, having the latex regurgitated in too great a proportion into the veſſels of the blood or other receptacles, from an obſtruction in the veins, which ſhould (if well diſpoſed) ſeparate from the blood an urinous latex, and by other more abbreviate paſſages betwixt the ſtomach and it, a great deal of the potulent parts taken in: but being obſtructed makes both regurgitate, the one into the veſſels of the blood, thereby vitiating its ferment by too great a dilution, which in the habit of the body cauſeth an Anaſarcoſis, and the other in the cavities of the <hi>abdomen,</hi> between the <hi>omentum</hi> and <hi>peritoncum</hi> ſwelling the belly cauſeth the Hydrops, which with a <hi>flatus</hi> extending the membranous parts, begets a Tympany.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. But if this ſpurious acidity reach the fourth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41152:48"/>digeſtion, where the animal ſpirits are fabricated, and there afflict the <hi>genus nervoſum,</hi> it cauſeth, by vitiating the ferment, ſcorbutick Palſies, Apoplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, Spaſms, Convulſions, and Cephalalgia's, which prove inveterate, and ſometimes Epilepſies; yet commonly this hoſtile acidity as ſolitary is not ſufficient to beget theſe ſcorbutick Apoplexies, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Epilepſies: but alſo hath <hi>quid cadaveroſum ſpirituale,</hi> and therefore <hi>viroſum;</hi> ſome ſpirituous putrid and therefore poyſonous matter to accompany it. By which I mean ſuch a portion of the nutritious juyce as not having received due fermentations in the ſeveral digeſtions, but become more and more vitiated and putrid, and being circulated from one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion to another, grows more putrid and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trative, and in continuance of time becomes ſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous, as to be able to inſinuate into the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired receſſes of the vital principles; for being by theſe rotations volatiz'd, hath more eaſie ingreſs into the inward retirements of the vital and animal fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: ſo that it becomes gradually exalted to a kind of virulency, which joyning iſſue with this tranſmitted ſpurious acidity, <hi>inſidiantur vitae,</hi> ſits upon the skirts of life, betrays it into the hands of theſe truculent Diſeaſes. Hence it is that the Palſie or Apoplexie prove ſuddainly mortal, if not at the firſt, yet commonly at the ſecond or third paroxyſm, and from the ſame baſis ariſeth the cauſes of other kinds of ſuddain deaths; for when this depraved, circulated matter, hath reached ſo far, and be wheeled ſo often, as to acquire a virulency or cadaverouſneſs, it then takes an occaſion by the next exorbitancy of the digeſtions, joyns hands with it, and conſpires the extinction of the vital flame.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. This fourth digeſtion, as I conceive, begins
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41152:49"/>in the arteries and is complete in the nerves; for when the alimentary juyce, being daſht with blood in the <hi>vena cava,</hi> receives a vital ferment in the heart, and becomes elaborate in the tunicles thereof, into a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicund balſamick liquor, which by the perſpiration of the lungs, in the bloods paſſage thorough the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na arterioſa,</hi> and <hi>arteria venoſa,</hi> receives a volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ferment from the air, conducing much to its circulation, is thence by the ſyſtole of the left ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle carryed into the <hi>aorta</hi> and other arteries: where the blood begins to be further elaborated for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of ſpirits, which may be ſubſervient for the animal functions of ſenſe and motion; where from the continual elixation of the blood in theſe veſſels, it begins to ſublime, or diſtil into more pure refined ſpirits, which paſs directly into their proper Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or Conduits, the Nerves, to complete their digeſtion and abſolve their function of ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for as much as every Arterie hath a vein and a nerve annexed to it, the one to carry away theſe volatile ſpirits, the other to bring back the blood, after it hath been exhauſted of theſe ſpirits, and ſpent its other balſamick parts, in nutrition in the habit of the body, to recive a freſh impregnation, by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ferment in the heart again, in its return out of the ſolid parts, by capillary veins into larger veſſels, untill it come to the <hi>vena cava,</hi> it meets with freſh nutritive juyce, coming from the jugular and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racical veſſels which thence paſs along together into the heart to become freſhly repleniſht with the vital balſam.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. So that theſe animal ſpirits are made in every part of the body, while the arterial blood is fraught with a vital ferment, out of which the Archeus by a further volatization hews forth theſe ſpirits: here
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41152:49"/>the hermetical adage is moſt true, <hi>id quod inferius, eſt ſicut id quod ſuperius, &amp; vice verſâ:</hi> for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal agents, if not interrupted, are alwaies and in every part at work, <hi>nunquam feriatur uatura;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſenſation and motion are alwaies and in every part, except ſome interrupting cauſe break the links of this noble chain.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Now any diſturbance in this digeſtion, ſuch as by a conflux of the foreſaid ſpurious hoſtile aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, cadaverous virulency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may confound and ſo blunder the texture of theſe ſpirits, as thence all the various exorbitances and different anomalous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, with all the heteroclite ſymptomes of the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus nervoſum</hi> are reducible, which I ſhall not now take the time further to illuſtrate. But paſs on;</p>
                  <p n="33">33. This exotick acidity coagulating the blood in the Matrix in women, is the author of moſt of their ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine infirmities; for in women who are not with child or give not ſuck, if all be well with them, the blood attempts to make a lunar evacuation, which it doth by ſeparating a portion thereof at the critical ſeaſon, into the veſſels of the Womb, which according to the intent of nature, is for the nouriſhing of the <hi>Foetus</hi> after conception, being a precurſory proviſion for that end: if no conception be, as in Maids, Widows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then nature endevevours to ſeparate, and carry away that ſuperfluous blood by veſſels fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpoſe, where it receives a fetid men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual virulent ferment, which gives the uncleaneſs (not to ſay more) to that evacuation.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Now when the ſuperfluous blood, is proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed into the remote veſſels ready to be expel'd, is there robb'd of the vital balſam, its <hi>Craſis</hi> perverted, and becomes infected with an acid virulent alumeniſh tincture, <hi>Nam lintcum menſtruo tinctum, ut</hi> Helmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41152:50"/>
                     <hi>loquitur, ſi demergatur in aquam bullientem, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culam contrahit inpoſterum indelibilem, quae tertiâ ſaltem elotione, excidit è linteo foraminato, non ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ac ſi ſpiritu ſulphuris acido aut tincturâ aluminoſa corroſum foret;</hi> which depraved virulent acidity is not tranſmitted from other digeſtions, but is innate and connatural to the place, like the ſtercorary fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>cacum</hi> and <hi>rectum</hi> of the Guts.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. If this virulent aerimony, with which the ſeparated menſtrual blood is vitiated, becomes by a retrograde motion revulſed into the veins or arteries where the vivid balſamick blood circulates, which is done ſometimes by unſeaſonable cold contracted at the criſis of evacuation, or by too much blood ſpent in veneſection, or by ſymptomatical enragements of that furibund animal the Matrix, or by what other cauſe ſoever, is I ſay the effectful cauſe of direful Diſeaſes, proper to that ſoft ſex, <hi>viz.</hi> Syncop's, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitations, Convulſions, and horrible ſtrangulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. For this exotick revuls'd virulency aſſaulting the blood and vital ſpirits therein, begins to ferment ſtrongly, ſmites the heart, or at leaſt thoſe balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick ſpirits which received vitality from the heart; thence immediately Swoonings, whereby for a time happens a ſuſpenſion of the vital offices, the pulſe ceaſeth or is weak, the ſpirits flag, the circulation of the blood is torpid, and all the vital powers ſhaken: ſometimes it ſtrikes the heart with a palpitation or trembling, <hi>viz.</hi> the vital ſpirits ſtand amazed, as if imitten with a thunder-clap from the uterine tox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icum; alſo it afflicts with Convulſions, making the animal ſpirits run counter, whirling them in oblique gyres to the contortion of the muſculous parts.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. And further by an influential manner, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41152:50"/>terrible ſtrangulations, by ſuddainly ſtopping the pores of the Lungs; and that too, though the Lungs be never ſo ſound (whence all ſuſpicion of any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt matter being there to cauſe the obſtructions, is taken away) as alſo the ſame is evident in that, after the ceſſation of the ſtrangulating paroxyſm, many times no inviſible evacuation follows: and this it doth I ſay by contracting the pores of the Lungs, whereby all reſpiration is intercepted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no pulſe, nor circulation of blood during that time; ſometimes this acrimonious virulency hath acceſs to the hypochonders, and there (eſpecially when it is acuated and grows more virulent by circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) it cauſeth Frenzies and Madneſs, which ſort Mania's prove difficult to cure, becauſe they are not generally right underſtood, what is the true effective or efficient cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. Thus in ſhort, of the cauſe of theſe terrifying Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of the female ſex. Now there are other more common (but leſs if at all virulent) Diſeaſes, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen frequently to women from the redundancy of blood, which not having been brought ſo far as to be proſcribed into the veſſels where uſually it receives the foreſaid menſtrual virulency, but is, becauſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, ready to be tranſported into the common <hi>cloaca;</hi> yet by obſtructions in the Matrix is ſent back into the maſs of blood, where it ſtuffs the veſſels, reſtagnates in ſome parts, cauſeth ſwellings, and coming too plentifully to the Heart, ſo as not being ſufficiently volatiz'd by the reſpiration of air, ſtuffs the Lungs, cauſing ſhort-windedneſs, heavineſs of ſpirits, which in young women cauſeth the Green-Sickneſs; in others indigeſtion of ſtomach, Pains, Gripings, Head-aches and other various ſymptomes: all which are curable by removing the foreſaid cauſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41152:51"/>of obſtructions, by aperient Medicines together with the breathing of a vein, which in theſe Diſeaſes of an inferior order, from the bare obſtructions and recurſions of blood, as blood, is not impertinent but of uſe, which in the other caſe of the revulſion of the virulent menſtrual ferment into the blood is dangerous, but eſpecially at that time when the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical evacuation happens; for then it becomes one of the chief cauſes of the retrogradation thereof into the blood, and of all the ſymptomes iſſuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. Laſtly if an exotick acidity be tranſmitted from the other previous digeſtions into the fifth or laſt, or become actually ingendred and foſtered therein, then it becomes the cauſe of many Diſeaſes found in thoſe parts, for in the ultimate digeſtion all aſſimilation of the nutritive juyce is made, ſo that every part according to the innate ferment thereof turns the one ſimilar aliment into its own likeneſs; whence then utrition of all though different parts from one and the ſame nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. But if this ferment of any part become alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from an inbred or tranſmitted acidity or ſowriſh ſaltneſs, it forthwith depraves the nouriſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and cauſeth Apoſthumations, Fiſtula's, Ulcers, Tumors, the Evil, Tetters, Inflammations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſometimes rouſeth up the paroxyſms of the Gout, or Sciatica; for we ſee that in Fiſtula's, Ulcers, or any other running Sores, if the Patient prove exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant in his Diet, either in eating ſaltiſh meats, or drinking too much ſtrong drink, or to petulant in venereal exerciſes, is eaſily diſcernable by the flux of the wound, which argues that the almentary juyce, made from the food taken in, retains ſome foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of its primitive nature, which it carries through
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41152:51"/>all the digeſtions, and therewith vitiates the very laſt; and according to the degree of the depravation of the ferment, and rawneſs of the nutritive juyce, the different ſorts of Ulcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceed.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. That the paroxyſm of the Gout may be rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up from the exorbitancy of a ſpurious acid fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ultimate digeſtion, is not uneaſie to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, if we conſider how ſome ſorts of <hi>French</hi> Wines, Gooſe, ſalt Meats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eaſily excite a fit of the Gout, to thoſe who are inclinable thereto, which they do either by retaining a ſpecifical ferment, through all the digeſtions untill they come to the <hi>ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novia</hi> of the Joynts, and there diſplay their hoſtileneſs to the parts by proritating the Gout; or rather they vitiate the alimentary Juyce, provoke a ſpurious fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Stomack, incenſe the Archeus, at whoſe beck all the digeſtions and ferments are ſubſervient; who preſently impreſſeth a fermental acidity upon tender <hi>ſynovia</hi> of the joynts, thence the Gout, and all its attendants begin to keep court.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Now the Gout is a ſeminal or Ideal Diſeaſe inſerted into the very initials of life, and therefore hereditary, which can lie long rooted in the very vital principles, ere it make it's firſt aſſault, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one fit and another, is as really preſent in its morbid character, as when cloathed with all its ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, only wants an acid ferment and a beck of the Archeus, to tranſmit it into the proper Matrix, which it no ſooner hath, but is <hi>podagra omnibus nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meris abſoluta,</hi> a complete Gout.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. But an objection meets me, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſeeing this ſpurious acidity in the alimentary juyce, as it paſſeth along from one digeſtion to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becomes the material cauſe of ſo many Diſeaſes, how comes it, that the Diſeaſes it cauſeth are not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41152:52"/>in the firſt, ſecond, or third digeſtion: ſeeing that in thoſe places by its action on the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their reaction upon it, oftentimes it loſeth its acrimony, and aſſumes ſome other property, which it carries into the ſubſequent digeſtions: and conſequently if it be carryed into the laſt digeſtion to make Diſeaſes there, it muſt firſt in its paſſage through the primary digeſtions, cauſe Diſeaſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to thoſe parts, whereas experience evinceth the contrary?</p>
                  <p n="44">44. To which I return, firſt by ſaying That all acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in ſubſequent digeſtions of the chyliferous juyce, are not always tranſmitted from that ſpurious one of the ſtomach: but ſometimes are new products hatcht in the very latter digeſtions, by the occaſional and ſpontaneal depravations of their ferments; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt only cauſe Diſeaſes where they are found. Next, That theſe tranſmitted acidities are ſometimes in other digeſtions tranſmuted into other properties, no leſs hurtful than before; as for inſtance, may be turn'd in the third digeſtion in the blood to a ſpurious ſaltiſhneſs or ſtyptickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as prejudicial to the balſam of the blood as the other would have been.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. And laſtly, I anſwer by ſaying, That ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acidities may be transferr'd at diſtances, <hi>ad nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Archei,</hi> at the beck of the Archeus, which is the overſeer of all the Engine-works of the digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as for inſtance, In thoſe erratick pains of the Gout, how ſuddainly will the Archeus (in whoſe <hi>aura vitalis</hi> the morbid character of that Diſeaſe, is intimately impreſt) tranſmit an acid ferment from one part to another, from the left foot to the right ſhoulder or arm, in a ſmall moment of time: yea from one foot to the contrary knee, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary foot in a little time: all which is done by an
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41152:52"/>Archeal tranſmiſſion of an acrimonious ferment, skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by an influential manner the intermediate parts, and hitting upon this or the others Juncture, ſets the humours of thoſe parts a working, which fretting the tender membranes and <hi>perioſtium,</hi> like a Mole ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times works under-ground, and otherwhiles throws up its little hills, <hi>viz.</hi> Tumors, Tophous knots and coagulations.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. NOw ſome may ſay, What's all this to the virtue of the <hi>Spaw</hi> water? The anſwering to which <hi>quaere,</hi> will give me liberty to proſecute what <hi>I</hi> aim at, <hi>viz.</hi> The reſtoration of the digeſtions, and redintegration of the blood and humours, by removing the interrupting obſtacles, and how far the virtue of the <hi>Spaw</hi> may reach in the cure of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Diſeaſes. For having in the former <hi>Section</hi> given a ſhort account of the eſſences, and original cauſes of many if not moſt Diſeaſes, what they are, and whence they proceed; how they ariſe from a vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſeveral ferments, either cauſing a rawneſs or over-acidneſs, or other hoſtile properties in the nutritive juyce, having diſtinguiſht them into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral claſſes of the digeſtions,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall therefore now ſignifie what Diſeaſes this <hi>Spaw</hi> is proper for what not, <hi>Helmont</hi> tells us, <hi>Potae Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danae non multùm conferunt in epidemicis, eudemicis, &amp; aſtralibus morbis, ut ſunt peſtis, pleuritis, prunella, &amp;c. nec quibus venenum ſubeſt vel aſſumptum vel intus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum vel contagio participatum, ut neque in morbis tincturae, quales ſunt lepra, lues Veneris, Morphea, Cancer, Epilepſia, &amp;c. viz.</hi> that the <hi>Spaw</hi> water avails nothing in peſtilential Diſeaſes, Pluriſies, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella's,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41152:53"/>Poyſons taken in or inbred, neither in the Leproſie, <hi>French</hi> Diſeaſe, Morphew, Cancer, Falling Sickneſs, nor in the Apoplexie, Palſie, or Aſthma.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And though in womens Diſeaſes upon occaſion of obſtructions of the Menſtrual evacuations, there may happen Epileptick, Paralytick, Apoplectick, and Aſthmatick affections, which by frequent drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> the obſtructions being thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, the foreſaid dreadful Diſeaſes may ceaſe; yet doth it not thence follow that they as ſuch Diſeaſes conſidered, as from their own natural cauſes, or as they are found in the male Sex, are therefore cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by drinking the <hi>Spaw</hi> water: ſo that, great diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt be made between thoſe Diſeaſes flowing from their natural ſeminaries in the body, and thoſe which proceed from the regimen of the Matrix, which <hi>Proteus</hi> like, puts on the ſame vizard of ſuch Diſeaſes, as if ſprung from their proper inbred cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the male kind.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So that to the curing of the Epilepſie, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie, Palſie and Aſthma, the ſolitary drinking of the <hi>Spaw</hi> (though accompanyed with all the rules imaginable) is not ſufficient, unleſs aſſiſted by the efficacy of ſome noble ſpecificks, which yet without the <hi>Spaws</hi> might do their work, though it's not amiſs to abſterſe the <hi>ſordes</hi> of the primary culinary digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the <hi>Spaw,</hi> which may thereby ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the energy of ſpecificks, whoſe work is to dint and mortifie that malignant-blaſs, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the virulent circulated recrement, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly ſurprizeth, ſtupifieth, and taketh the animal ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For in the Epilepſie, the circulated cadaverous excrement, coming to its maturity brings on a fit
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41152:53"/>of that Diſeaſe, by impugning the <hi>aura vitalis</hi> of the Archeus. From the antipathetical concourſe of which two, ariſeth a ſecret incoercible <hi>flatus,</hi> which being pent up by obſtructions in the ultimate digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſmites <hi>(quaſi ictu oculi)</hi> the animal ſpirits, which ceaſing to act, the body falls down; or if they act, it's after a retrograde and irregular manner, cauſing Convulſions, and Diſtortions, of the muſculous parts; but the <hi>flatus</hi> being after a while diſperſt, the ſpirits return to their former offices. Which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens otherwiſe in apoplectick and paralytick Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for though there be the ſame concurring cauſes; to theſe as to that of the Epilepſie and a <hi>flatus,</hi> which at the ſecond or third fit proves mortal, by ſecretly ſtifling the ſpirits; yet the <hi>flatus</hi> inclines to one ſide of the body, ſtriking in with the <hi>peroledi</hi> (if I may ſo call them) or influential chanels of the Microcoſm, ſettles the anodynous, cadaverous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement in the organs of Senſe and Motion: and there lodgeth along time, to the great diſinablement of the animal ſpirits; hence the tediouſneſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of apoplectick and paralytick paroxyſms.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The incoercible <hi>flatus</hi> which accompanies theſe Diſeaſes, is no better demonſtrable, than by putting one ounce of <hi>ſal-armoniack</hi> into four ounces of <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis,</hi> ſtop the glaſs up cloſe, and in half an hour or leſs you will be convinced of the power of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coercible glaſs; for you will ſee the glaſs, and that with a great noiſe, broken into many ſhivers: which happens from the antipathy of thoſe two, working one upon the other, exciting thereby a ſtrong <hi>flatus,</hi> which being pent up by the ſealing or ſtopping of the glaſs, forceth its paſſage by breaking the glaſs, though never ſo ſtrong.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. So in the body of man, the incoercible <hi>flatus</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:41152:54"/>ariſing from the mutual contact of the circulated ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daverous recrement, and the <hi>aura vitalis;</hi> though it ſplits not the body; yet it either quite extinguiſheth the vital taper, or at leaſt flattens and diſinableth the animal ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Now the remedy muſt either be equivalent to the cauſe or it effects nothing. But the <hi>Spaw</hi> water comes ſhort, and reacheth not to thoſe inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes where the animal ſpirits lie on their death-bed, and therefore can adminiſter no help; eſpecially if the Diſeaſe by graduated to the maturity of one or two paroxyſms. For though by abſterſing the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary digeſtions, it may help to prevent the plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ingendring of the excrements in the after-digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and ſo conſequently if timely taken might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the occaſional cauſe thereof: yet if the Diſeaſe have once become raiſed from its ſeminaries to a full ſtature; then nothing but ſpecificks will doe: ſuch I mean as hath power not only of correcting and preventing the enormous <hi>flatus,</hi> but alſo of abſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſubtle cadaverous <hi>ſordes,</hi> repoſed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward chanels of the animal ſpirits, by inclining them to a tranſpiration: ſweetning alſo the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant ſpurious acidities, which is particularly done by ſome noble vitriolin Arcana's: The <hi>Elixir Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is not curable by the <hi>Spaw,</hi> being too languid in its virtue to reach the Lungs; eſpecially when it is come on to the ripeneſs of an Aſthma: is curable by the former ſpecificks, and that becauſe an Aſthma, Epilepſie, Apoplexie and Palſie, are identical in their material and efficient cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſame circulated, anodynous, cadaverous recrement, ſettling in different places cauſe the foreſaid Diſeaſes; in the brain, the Epilepſie; in the membranous and nervous parts, the Apoplexie and Palſie. If it only vitiate the organs of motion <hi>ſalvo ſenſu,</hi> then it's the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; but if both motion and ſenſe be deprav'd, and that with a vibration upon one ſide, or through the whole body, then it is ſurely an Apoplexie.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But if by a tranſmigration of this peccant matter, it become coagulated in the Lungs, then an Aſthma; of which as alſo of the other ſyncriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſeaſes, I may ſay as formerly hath been of the Quartain, That they are <hi>ludibria Medicorum,</hi> and therefore to be found only in the Catalogue of Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables. And, what's the matter? Nothing but we want well prepared Medicines; which either our idleneſs, or our ignorance, or both, will not ſuffer us to attain to.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Theſe Diſeaſe being congenial in their cauſes, are the ſame in their Cures; therefore none of them curable by the ſolitary aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spaws:</hi> but by the power of abſterſive and reſtorative Arcana's, ſuch as the aforeſaid remedies and the like.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It is true Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> brings in two inſtances of the virtue of the water in the Palſie: but if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, The Diſeaſe in both Patients was at the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hand; and probably nature by degrees might have wrought it forth, without the help of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. It's very probable the change of air, and the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41152:55"/>exerciſe of the body by riding, might contribute as much to the Patients aſſiſtance as the water. Beſides it may be, The paroxyſm of this Diſeaſe might be haſtened by the exorbitancy of the ſtomach and foulneſs thereof, which being rectified by the abſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive property of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> might be alleviated thereby.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. He gives one, and but one inſtance of help in the Epilepſie by the water. He tells us of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſucceſs he had ſeen in that one that was Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: but how or after what manner it appeared we muſt not know; though he doth indeed ingenuouſly confeſs, if the Diſeaſes of the Palſie, Epilepſie, Vertigo, be idiopathick, be radically in the head; or otherwiſe though the malady ariſe from ſympathy, if it be in the begining of the paroxyſm; or in its ſtate, the morbid humour being fixed, in ſuch caſes he acknowledgeth the improperneſs of the water.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Where by the way take notice, that thoſe three Diſeaſes have not always the head for their principal ſeat; for though in the Epilepſie and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo, in the one there be a vellication of the membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and perhaps nervous parts of the brain: and in the other a conſternation of the animal ſpirits, lodg'd there; and that either by a deuteropathy, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd from other parts, or by an idiopathy in the very membranous and nervous parts themſelves: yet notwithſtanding the Palſie hath not its original ſeat, in the head, but in the <hi>genus nervoſum,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the animal ſpirits; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be, and is in other parts of the body, <hi>ſalvo capitis regimine.</hi> For it is the cataſtrophe of theſe ſpirits, that gives being to the paroxyſm of theſe Diſeaſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Epilepſie and Palſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when ever they are found ſmitten with a <hi>flatus</hi> ariſing from the antipathy of the putredinous, cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verous
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41152:55"/>recrement, and the <hi>aura vitalis,</hi> there to be ſure is the Diſeaſe, in what part ſoever of the body it is found.</p>
                  <p>To confirm which, <hi>viz.</hi> that the head is not the chief ſeat of the Palſie, I ſhall bring in a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inſtance of a paralytick Patient, to whom I had the hap to be called, after ſeven or eight other Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and pretenders to Phyſick had been conſulted, he lives in <hi>Fernedale</hi> belonging to the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham.</hi> This Patient had lingred moſt part of two years under his Diſtemper; the occaſional cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, as far as I could learn, either from the damp of the earth, being imployed to over-ſee, and ſometimes did work in an <hi>Hough</hi> (as the Country-People call it) of <hi>Blacomoore,</hi> for ſome ſuppos'd Mine of <hi>Plute,</hi> ſome treaſure deeply lodg'd in the earth, but found none; or elſe by going into the water in the Summer time to Fiſh, either of which might occaſionally give being to his Diſeaſe. He was gradually taken of all his joynts; and ſometimes had neither ſenſe nor motion in moſt parts of his body; but moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not altogether, had little or no ſenſe, eſpecially from the lower parts of his body downward: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as if any weight lay heavy on thoſe parts, or any great heat from the fire ſcorched them, he was not ſenſible, nor at all complain'd. He could moſtwhat move all his joynts as he ſate or laid, and that pretty nimbly; but when he came to ſtand, his knees ſhaked under him, his legs bended, and he glad to be held up from falling in ones arms. His hands and arms he could move very well, but when he came to take up any meat to put in his mouth, he always either left it or let it fall; ſo was helped by another, both for his meat and drink taking. Yet all this while <hi>ſalvoregimine capitis,</hi> had all his ſenſes in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41152:56"/>his head; for ſaving a glimmering of his eyes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he could not read diſtinctly, which might very probably be from the weakneſs of the optick nerves, together with ſome alteration of the texture of the vitreous and criſtaline humors thereof: I ſay except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this weakneſs in his eyes, he had his memory as perfect as ever, could caſt Account as well as before; had his hearing, taſte, and ſmelling in good order; could eat his meat pretty well, without the leaſt trembling or ſhaking of his head.</p>
                  <p>The Phyſicians he had conſulted, had ordered him Vomits and Purges in great plenty, Unguents not a few, and Baths too many; for he was alway the worſe after them. They ſo much enfeebled him, as that he loſt the uſe of his limbs for a time after; and almoſt weakened him to death.</p>
                  <p>The Medicines I ordered him were chiefly vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirits, <hi>viz. Spiritus Salis Armoniaci</hi> to ſmell at, and <hi>Spiritus Sanguinis</hi> to take inwardly, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Plaiſter of Muſtard Seed and Vinegar, anointed over with the Balſam of Antimony, Amber, Turpentine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> applyed to the ſhaved crown of his head.</p>
                  <p>The volatile Spirits had a very remarkable opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſo often as he held the bottle to his noſtrils (which he would do a long time together, having an eager deſire of receiving benefit by what was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him) he could after a while feel it run ſenſibly down the <hi>vertcbrae</hi> of his back, diſperſe it ſelf into his loyns, and upon thoſe parts to bring a fine gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle warmth, which before uſually were very cold, and then run down to his very feet, alſo to run along his arms to his very fingers ends, with a dindling and pricking as it run along; but he had not this ſenſe of this operation of the volatile Spirits (he ſmelt to)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41152:56"/>at the firſt, till he had ſeveral times taken inwardly the <hi>Spiritus Sanguinis,</hi> which uſually brought him into a moiſt ſweat, thereby opening obſtructions of the <hi>genus nervoſum;</hi> after the uſe of theſe, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, he found a ſtiffneſs in the ſinewy parts of his joynts; then began the ſhaking and trembling of his joynts (upon endevouring to ſtand, or to go a little which before frequently troubled him) to go away, and that ſtiffneſs brought ſtrength from the ſinews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the muſculous parts; ſo that he could after the uſe of theſe awhile, go a little alone upon the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floor, and begun to get the ſenſe and uſe of his hands, ſo that he can now, not only ſerve himſelf, but cut his own meat which he never could do before, ſince the Diſtemper ſeiz'd upon him, alſo can put on his own cloaths.</p>
                  <p>From all which duely weighed, reſults theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſiderations. Firſt, hence appears the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Patients do not uſually reap that expected benefit from volatile Spirits, in theſe and ſuch like Diſeaſes; for theſe Spirits, whether inwardly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly adminiſtred, or both, are neither palata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor pleaſant to the ſmell; but being nimble and quick, do <hi>ferire nares,</hi> after a ſmart manner, which many people (too much indulging their ſenſe and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat) will not have the patience to undergoe, but boggle and fly back at the firſt onſet of ſuch penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Medicines, and conſequently deny themſelves the expected efficacy thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. That ſenſe and motion are the products of life, and not the life it ſelf; for this Patient ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lay void of any viſible ſenſe or motion: and that once or twice after he came out of his Baths, and yet life was preſent; ſo that all vital functions, whether fermentations, heat, motion, ſenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:41152:57"/>performed by organical parts, are but the ſequels and poſterior products of the <hi>anima ſenſitiva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly. That ſenſe and motion are different mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications of the animal Spirits in the <hi>genus nervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> and membranous parts of the body. For it is not enough that nervous veſſels be replete with ſo many of the animal Spirits, as to give motion to the muſcles, and thoſe to the joynts; I ſay to have ſuch ſtore of theſe Spirits in thoſe veſſels, as to cauſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not enough alſo to cauſe ſenſe, unleſs theſe Spirits retain their natural ſting and acuteneſs, by which they communicate that we call ſenſe, to all the membranous parts of the body, as happened to this Patient, and ſo <hi>vice verſâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spirits may be acute enough, and give their vibration to all the membranous parts, ſo as to cauſe ſenſe; and yet the motion of thoſe Spirits, may be ſo intercepted and dull'd, in the nervous veſſels of ſome parts of the body, as to cauſe a defect of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſame parts, which happens in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of paralytick and apoplectick perſons; only with this difference, that the <hi>virus cadaveroſum, viz.</hi> the putredinous, anodynous, circulated recrement, which is with the exploſive incoercible <hi>flatus</hi> thence ariſing, the efficient cauſe of all the Diſeaſes of the <hi>genus nervaſum,</hi> whether Palſies, Apoplexies, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilepſies, Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The foreſaid anodynous recrement, is I ſay more or leſs according to whoſe graduated accumulation, the Diſeaſe becomes more or leſs mortal. For if this recrement be ultimately car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed and ſettled in the membranous parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; then becomes the ſenſe deprav'd as happened in this Patient: but if it ſeize upon the animal Spirits in their current glidings along their own veſſels, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their remora, mortifies them in ſome parts,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41152:57"/>thence comes the depravation of motion and all ſymptomes, accompanying the common ſort of Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Apoplexies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly. Hence it alſo appears that the volatile Spirits in the blood, are of the ſame family with thoſe of the <hi>genus nervoſum,</hi> and membranous parts; only in their own veſſels they receive a more natural determination to their proper functions of ſenſe and motion. For unleſs the blood give being to the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, they are not: and unleſs they were a kin to thoſe ſaline Spirits in the blood, the Patient could not upon the uſe thereof, I mean of the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirits of blood, have perceived his joynts to have become more ſtiff and ſtrong than before.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly. That there is a concatenation of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the <hi>genus nervoſum,</hi> and anaſtomoſis of one into another, through the texture of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, was apparent; in that the Patient felt ſenſibly, the volatile Spirits which he ſtrongly ſmelt at, to paſs through the proceſſes of the <hi>medulla ſpinalis</hi> down the <hi>vertebrae</hi> into his loyns, and ſo down to his feet, alſo along his arms to his hands, and to his very fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends. Whence alſo it is more than probable, that the ſpringy motion of the animal Spirits, in the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous kind, have their original in the brain; for as the heart is the ſpring of all the Arteries, the liver of all the Veins: ſo likewiſe the brain of all the Nerves. Which yet doth not infringe our doctrine of the generation of the animal Spirits from the Spirits of the blood; being the pure defecate eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts thereof, ingendred from all parts of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial blood, becomes exquiſitely elaborated in their own veſſels: and at length receive a determination of motion in the brain.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly. That the head is not the chief ſeat of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41152:58"/>Palſie, was evident in this Patient; for all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his head were untouch'd, ſave a weakneſs as I ſaid of his eyes: ſo that the animal Spirits in what part ſoever of the body, are the ſubject matter upon which the cadaverous recrement ſeizing, gives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Diſeaſes of the <hi>genus nervoſum.</hi> And that without reſpect to the head, unleſs the ſame efficient cauſe be there; and then indeed it gives original to the Epilepſie, Catalepſie, Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of that part. More obſervations I could make, but am not willing to proſecute them to the full at this time, till I am more confirmed by ſome collateral experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The Doctor gives us two inſtances of the Cure of the Aſthma by the Water, <hi>viz.</hi> of an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Hull,</hi> and of a Gentlewoman. As to the firſt we anſwer, that it is very (if not more than) probable, That the Aſthma, wherewith the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laboured was from a deuteropathy, from a ſtuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſtomach, which might compreſs and ſtreighten the Diaphragm, as alſo from ſome trivial obſtructions in the lungs, which together might very well produce a ſpurious Aſthma or Shortneſs of Breath; than which in ordinary foulneſs and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of uhe ſtomach, nothing is more frequent: and upon that account might eaſily enough be cured by the Water, which doth notably cleanſe the <hi>ſordes</hi> of the ſtomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that this was a real Aſthma, I fear the Doctor miſtakes in his diagnoſticks.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And as for the other Cure of the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I cannot otherwiſe apprehend from his enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of concomitant circumſtances, but that it was from an uterine cauſe, <hi>Aſthma ex regimine matricis influentiali prognatum:</hi> and ſo was not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily in the Lungs, but only ſecondary and ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatical,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41152:58"/>depending upon the depraved occonomy of the Womb; and that from inordinate obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein, which was caus'd, as I ſuppoſe, from cold taken at an unſeaſonable time, when Nature was about its critical evacuation. Now the <hi>Spaws,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the aperient Mineral Salt therein contained, was very proper for opening thoſe obſtructions, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away what ought to be by thoſe inferior chanels; and ſo conſequently the cauſe being removed, the ſymptomatical Aſthma might by degrees ceaſe: in which judgment I am further confirm'd, in that he ſaith that not long after ſhe had a Child.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. As for Rheumes or Catarrhs, He mentions one that received benefit thereby, which Diſeaſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> as I apprehend, proceeds from vapours, aſcending from the ſtomach, which being condenſed by the coldneſs of the brain, and obſtructions in the head, diſtill <hi>per foramen palati,</hi> thorough the ſmall chanel of the palate, or by the noſthrils, which falling upon the Lungs brings a Cough, and ſometimes a Conſumption, and deſcending in other chanels, cauſe other Diſeaſes; all which may indeed be reckoned <hi>inter deliramenta Catarrhi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. The eſſentials of which Diſeaſe we deny, <hi>viz.</hi> any vapours to ariſe from the digeſtion of the meat in the ſtomach, after ſuch a manner as <hi>vapore terus</hi> to reach the head. Which ſuppoſe we ſhould grant, let us ſee what abſurdities would follow; firſt, no ſooner would the meat and drink be taken into the ſtomach, but the heat and moiſture therein would forthwith ſend up vapors, and we ſhould thereupon be conſtantly troubled with Catarrhs.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the moſt ſound ſtrong ſtomachs whoſe heat was lively, would certainly always breed Catarrhs, becauſe of ſending up moſt powerfull vapours, from
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41152:59"/>the liquid parts of food; alſo in cold Winters, from the forcible injury of the cold air, working upon the brain, and cauſing a cold Diſtemper there, we ſhould never be kept free from a Catarrh; not to ſay what conſtant droppings there would be at the pipe of the Alembick, the Noſe, enough to fill a Receiver in a little time; and to make every one go with one, hung at his Noſe.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Alſo it would follow that all defluxions of Rheumes ſhould have but one taſte, and that inſipid too; becauſe if the vapours, ſuppoſe in a pot, ariſe from never ſo many ſorts of meats, where there is a competent moiſture: yet that which is ſav'd by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſing, will have but one taſte, <hi>viz.</hi> an elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſimple water; whence therefore according to their own doctrine, ſhould the variety of conſiſtence, and taſts proceed; that one ſhould be falt, another ſharp and fretting; one thin, and another more thick? So that difficulties and abſurdities on all hands, ſit upon the skirts of this doctrin of a Catarrh.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. To be poſitive, We ſay the ſtomach no ſooner receives food into it, but it cloſeth the upper mouth, and the membranous oeſophagus claps cloſe together; which alſo happens at every bit that is ſwallowed down, ſo that no vapours can paſs it; and though vapours ſhould ariſe (which no doubt in ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities they do) from the lower concave of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, where the food lyes, to the upper part thereof; yet they are carryed up with ſo eaſie a digeſtive heat, as that they circulate and fall back upon the digeſtive maſs again, like a globe of glaſs half filled, whoſe neck is cloſe ſealed up, and ſet in an eaſie heat of digeſtion, the ſteams which ariſe, circulate back again upon the matter, without any preſſing thorough the neck of the glaſs, or any danger of breaking the glaſs.</p>
                  <p n="22">
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:41152:59"/>22. It is true that from the incongruity of the food in the ſtomack, and from the reluctancy thereof, and the indigeſtion thence following, a <hi>flatus, ſpiritus ſylveſtris,</hi> or incoercible gas may ariſe, which not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly finding vent, by the opening of the upper mouth of the ſtomack, ſtretcheth the membranous parts thereof, makes one ſick and faint; but at length get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting paſſage by the upper Portall, flaps open the Oeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus, whisks forth with a ſudden noiſe of a ructure or belch. This <hi>flatin,</hi> or wind, carries with it the odour or taſte of that part of the food which is moſt difficultly digeſted; and this is all the vapour which is carried up: which yet is not a vapour, but an incoer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible wind, never condenſable (as all vapours are) into water.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. But it may be objected, That if no ſteams or vapours, are carried up from the ſtomack to the brain, as is uſually and vulgarly ſuppoſed, how comes it to paſs, that after meat, we commonly find our ſelves dull and indiſpoſed, and, as it were, heavy to ſleep many times, Is it not from the vapours which aſcend into the head, and incline to heavineſs?</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer no. But we are then inclinable to an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs and ſleepyneſs, from the ſame cauſe we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to the ſame at any time; ſleep follows wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as night the day; heavineſs and dulneſs are as precurſory to ſleep, as the evening to the night; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is a vigilancy and action of the ſpirits, each ſtanding centinel in the Portalls of the ſenſes; ſleep is a quieſcence of the ſpirits from their action; the animal Spirits are after a time of working wearied, and willingly give themſelves up to a laſſation, for a further recruit: ſo that there is no need of vapours to ariſe into the head to cauſe ſleep. For though a man faſt 24 hours, or longer, and conſequently hath ſmall
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41152:60"/>matter left on his ſtomack to cauſe vapours; yet is he nevertheleſs inclinable to ſleep: and many can ſleep as ſoundly upon an empty, as a foul ſtomack. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment either in mind or body, keeps the Spirits in action, and awake; once give way by Idleneſs, or ſolitary ſitting after meat, or at other times, and a dulneſs begins, which is the Harbinger of ſleep, and the Spirits fair and eaſily fall to reſt.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Another Objection offers it ſelf, How comes it, That when we drink plentifully of ſtrong Drink, we become ſtupid and inebriate therewith, is it not from the vapours of the ſtrong Drink, aſcending into the head, that makes a man drunk?</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is no. For ſtrong Drink is no ſooner taken (if in an exceſſive quantity) but the ſubtle inebriating Sulphur thereof begins to act upon the Spirits, whether animal or vital, communicable with the brain, by the nerves of the ſixth conjugation, and every where at work in all parts of the body; ſo that there is neither need of aſcending nor deſcending, the Spirits which are overcome by the <hi>toxicum</hi> of ſtrong Drink, are every where preſent, and as eaſily oppreſs'd in the ſtomack by the inebriating Sulphur of vinous Spirits, as in any place.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. But before I go from the figment of a Catarrh, I ſhall give you ſome account how I apprehend that defluxion of Rheume to happen, which I have denied to proceed from vapours aſcending from the ſtomack. It is therefore a ſpurious depravation of the <hi>Latex</hi> which runs along with the blood, and is every where while in the channels of the veins and arteries, one with it under a ruby colour; but upon any injury in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon any part, is almoſt at hand, at the beck of the Archens, ready to be ſeparated from its boon companion the blood: and to aſſiſt towards a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41152:60"/>waſhing of that ſtain impreſs'd upon the weakned part.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. So that if any injury of Cold become as a Thorn, to prick or offend any part (which is the ſame as is meant by taking of Cold) preſently the <hi>Latex</hi> (which upon all ſuch occaſions is ready at hand) is commanded away, to bring what ſpeedy help may be to the injured part; but not being able to perform that work, by reaſon of the prevalency of the thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impreſſion (if I may ſo call it) becomes rather tainted thereby, receiving an exotick ferment from the injured part; becomes thereby the Patron of all thoſe exorbitant defluxions, which are accompanied with pains, inflammations, or the like. This falling upon the <hi>Larynx</hi> already alienated from an injury of Cold, is ſometimes turned into a copious mucous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, frequently expell'd by a Coughing.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. But if the <hi>Larynx</hi> happen to be debilitated through a continual defluxion thereof, then it falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lungs, where it perverts the alimentary juyce of that part, turns it into a putrelaginous corrupt matter, which as worm'd up by the force of a Cough, ſtill increaſeth as faſt; ſo as at length fretting upon the ſpungy ſubſtance of the Lungs, wears them away: hence Ulcers of the Lungs, <hi>Tabes</hi> or Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. If the <hi>Oſſa Ithmoeida</hi> in the Noſtrils, be the parts affected from an injury of the cold Air, or ſmoke of Coals, or other bad offenſive fumes; thence a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryza, viz.</hi> a Diſeaſe we ſhould all be troubled with, in caſe that vapours actually aſcended from the ſtomack to the head. If the eyes be the parts offended, thence an <hi>Ophthalmia, viz.</hi> a defluxion of Rheums, with an accompanied inflammation. If the teeth, or nervous parts therein be offended, and that from the injury of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41152:61"/>the Air reaching thither through the hollowneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thence an <hi>Odontalgia, viz.</hi> Tooth-ach, with a defluxion of Rheum, or portion of <hi>Latex</hi> ſhowring down that way.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Beſides the exotick quality the <hi>Latex</hi> gets from injured parts, to which it is carried by the next adjacent <hi>glandules,</hi> to waſh away the things offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or the impreſſion it hath left behind; as if a Mote injure the Eye, a great quantity of <hi>Latex</hi> will preſently flow to it, to waſh it out; and that too from the ſoundeſt of bodies. The like happens, if any volatile acrimonious Spirits, as of vinous, Sal armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack or Harts-horn, ſmite the Noſtrils, preſently an inſipid <hi>Latex</hi> runs to the affected part, and makes the Noſe run. The like alſo, if any unwonted taſte offend the Palate, what a ſpitting doth it cauſe, which is nothing but an inſipid <hi>Latex,</hi> which haſts away to waſh off the impreſſion the offenſive thing hath left. ſo a thorn pricking any fleſhy part, preſently the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent <hi>Latex</hi> is ſent away, which endeavouring to waſh off the impreſſion the Thorn hath left, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, thence upon a further conflux of more <hi>Latex,</hi> comes a tumour, and a pulſe, a pain and inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being vitiated by the perverted fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the part, turns ſometimes to an Ulcer.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. I ſay, beſides the hurtful quality the <hi>Latex</hi> gets from the injured parts, it alſo ſometimes becomes depraved, and badly qualified, from ſome inbred cauſe, even in the very veſſels of the blood, or in the lympheducts, often tinctured with an hoſtile, ſharp, pontick, ſaltiſh acrimony; which upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is often proſcribed from the oeconomy of life, into ſome external parts, <hi>quibus poenas luit,</hi> whom it puniſheth with its own crime, tainting them with that they knew not before. If this by the motion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41152:61"/>be thrown upon any part, it actually weakens it, by impreſſing its own character thereon; <hi>Hinc tincturae ac impreſſiones venenoſae in vitam durabiles:</hi> if it be thrown upon the Lungs, it certainly cauſeth a <hi>phthiſis, Tabes;</hi> or Conſumption, wears away the life inſenſibly.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. If upon the <hi>menninges</hi> of the brain; hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate and moſt obſtinate head-aches, not bending unleſs to the beſt of Arcana's: If upon the Eyes, it cauſeth Opthalmia's of moſt difficult cure: If upon the Gums, it ulcerates them, looſening the Teeth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with intolerable pains: If upon the Palate, it ulcerates and mortifies them; and in the French Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, it is that ſpurious <hi>Latex,</hi> which retains the veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous properties, for wherever it ſettles it ulcerates, when tainted with the venom of that Diſeaſe. It is alſo the author of Scorbutick, and other cacoethical Ulcers.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. The waters of the <hi>Spaw</hi> may, I confeſs, at the long run, and with continual uſe for a competent time, help to dint the acrimony of this ſpurious <hi>Latex</hi> if it be not too much graduated, nor hath not too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately weakned the parts; for then nothing ſhort of noble Chymical Arcana's, that are enriched with a penetrative and reſtorative Balſom will effect the cure: ſuch as are the Spirit of Salt of Tartar, the prepared Sulphur of Vitriol, the <hi>tinctura lilii,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Now as the forenamed Diſeaſes are not cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the <hi>Spaw;</hi> ſo neither are Fevers, eſpecially continued; for a Fever is a ſpurious fermentation of the blood, from a depravation of the Elementary juyce, coming too crudely into the third digeſtion, where it ſhould be elaborated into vital blood; but by reaſon of its rawneſs, or other alienated proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it perverts the natural ferment of the heart, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41152:62"/>a preternatural working and boyling in the blood, by reaſon of plenty of Heterogeneities that are heapt up with the nutritive juyce.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Now whatever hinders the natural fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood from purifying it ſelf by ſeparation of Heterogeneities, that, I ſay, rather aggrayates, than abates a Fever; but ſuch is the coldneſs of the water, (Cold being the great enemy to the ferments of the digeſtions) that it rather abates, and takes off from the vital fermentation, than otherwiſe; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuffers the blood to be ſtuff'd with a greater plenitude of indigeſted Crudities, thereby aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the febrile fermentation, and increaſing all the Symptoms thereunto belonging.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. And as cold water increaſeth a Fever, ſo alſo all cold or cool things do more harm than good; yea, even the cooling Julips preſcribed by the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> yield very ſmall help, if they do not actually preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice Nature, in the purifying work of fermentations: ſo that whatever is adminiſtred in Fevers, if it have not reſpect either to abſterſion of the <hi>ſordes,</hi> in the firſt, ſecond, or third digeſtion; or to promote the natural fermentation of the blood, where Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neities are preſent, and ſo move <hi>ad diaphoreſin;</hi> or to ſtay the overmuch fermenting, when it is ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous: Or laſtly, to fortifie the digeſtions and vital ſpirits, againſt the aſſaults of the Diſeaſe. If it have no reſpect to one of theſe three, it is, I ſay, altogether impertinent and frivolous.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. But neither cooling Julips, as I ſaid before, nor the Shop Cordials, compounded moſt what of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups, Confections, Strong-waters, and the like, all whick are cumbred with ſtore of Sugar, that clog and oppreſs the ſtomack; which thereupon can receive little benefit from the vertue of the Ingredients, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41152:62"/>ſo becomes tantaliz'd by the farraginous mixtures of Concretes, which taken ſimply, might help Nature more effectually, and be leſs burdenſom to the digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I ſay, neither do theſe ſtuffing Cordials contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any help to the forenamed intentions. For what is truly Cordial, muſt have a power to allay Wind; and if I affirm, That nothing is effectually Cordial, but ſuch as doth <hi>compeſcere flatum,</hi> oppoſe, or take away Wind, I think I ſhall be able to make it good: and that thus.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. By Wind, I mean ſuch a wild incoercible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Gas (whatever we may call it) which ariſeth from a reluctancy of the nutritive juyce, or reliques, or recrement thereof, to the ferment of the ſtomack, or other parts; which the ferments not being able to maſter, either through their own debilitude, or through ſome ſtubborn untameable parts of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary juyce, or recrement thereof, begets this wild uncoagulable Spirit we call Wind; which being pent up; not finding vent, ſtretcheth the tunicles of the ſtomack, or membranes of other parts in other digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, regurgitates upon the <hi>anaſtomaſis</hi> of ſome veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels into the ſtomack, and upon others adjacent, which contain blood and vital Spirits, whom it almoſt ſtifles, put Nature thereby upon the Tenter-hooks: Hence pains, yea, all ſorts of faintneſs and ſickneſs.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. Now whatever takes away this cauſe, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or <hi>flatus</hi> failing, is truly Cordial; but all other contriv'd Cordials, which reach not this root of Wind, are in vain. It is not enough to make one rift or belch, though that many times gives much eaſe; but to ſtrengthen the digeſtions, and to abſterſe the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional cauſe, thereby preventing a ſpurious fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe product is a <hi>flatus.</hi> This, I ſay, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to allay Wind, and to become truly Cordial.</p>
                  <p n="39">
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41152:63"/>39. It we examine the <hi>Galenical</hi> Shop-Cordials, and their other Confectionary Medicaments, we ſhall find the main pillar of them all to be Sugar, witneſs their Electuaries, Looch's, Conſerves, Syrups, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Cordial waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes are ſo clogg'd, as ſcarce one ray of a ſpecifick can eſcape the clouds to illuminate the Archeus, when they paſs the ſtomack into other digeſtions; and through the prevalency of the Diſeaſe, wanting a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latizing ferment, a great part of the Cordials, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sugar-part, turns into a <hi>caput mortis:</hi> which rather increaſeth a feveriſh fermentation, than otherwiſe. Thus the very Cordials of the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, prove burdenſom to Nature.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. And as cooling Julips, nor Shop-Cordials: ſo neither Phlebotomy, after that frequent manner it is uſed, availeth any thing as to the three aforeſaid indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; not as to the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> abſterſion of <hi>ſordes;</hi> for in opening of a vein, both good and bad go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. If indeed the worſt parts of the blood could be ſingled out from the reſt, then letting of blood would prove a ſingular remedy; but the beſt way, the moſt balſamick parts of the blood, are carried forth with other parts thereof: inaſmuch as the very next blood to the Orifice, is firſt carried forth, which perhaps is the moſt free from the morbid impreſſion.</p>
                  <p n="41">41.. Nor ſecondly, doth it promote the natural fermentation of the blood, eſpecially where the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe hath, through continuance of time, weakned the digeſtions, impoveriſhed the blood of Spirits by a ſolution of its compage, exhauſted the volatile balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick parts thereof; for in ſuch caſes, the maſs of blood is ſo degenerated from its former <hi>eucraſia,</hi> as that an infuſion of well-ſpirited balſamick blood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to late Experiments, would rationally be
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41152:63"/>more pertinent, than the taking away part of that, wherein that ſpark of life yet remaining is lodg'd; for in the blood is the life, and the powers and ſtrength of life; how much of the blood is taken away, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by reiterate bloodings (as the cuſtom of ſome; not to excuſe the Doctor) ſo much is Nature actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally debilitated, the digeſtions perverted, and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the blood ſpoyled, at leaſt ſo weakned, as to repair the loſs of the volatile balſamick ſpirits requires a long time. And as the blood hath a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation whereby it endeavours the ſeparation of congeſted Heterogeneities, whoſe preſence cauſe ſome ſort of Fevers, to which the uſe of Diaphoreticks are very proper; ſo alſo the fermentation thereof may ſometimes be ſpontaneouſly ſpurious, ſet at work by attempting a new <hi>craſis, viz.</hi> intentionally to refine, and make it ſelf a more depurate and defecate liquor, which in Children being ſet a working, occaſionally from the inherent <hi>recrementa uteri,</hi> cauſeth the Small Pox, Meaſles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and being once ſet a work, doth ſometimes ove-ferment, thereby ſpending the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile ſaline parts of the blood, and gives the Sulphur thereof an <hi>empyrheuma,</hi> ſeparating the eſſential prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the blood, ſubverting the <hi>craſis</hi> thereof, extinguiſheth the vital flame; which overfermenting of the blood, not only happens to Children, but alſo to more grown perſons, which requires ſome peculiar remedies, leaſurely to put a ſtop thereto; and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Phlebotomy, which may anſwer the drawing forth of Wines out of the veſſels, when they ferment too ſtrongly: or by ſome proper Emetick, for ſuch fermentations are rarely perform'd without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>ſordes</hi> of the ſtomack; which anſwers the taking away of the Tartar from the ſides of the Wine-veſſels, from whoſe too great plenty, ſometimes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41152:64"/>happens the overworking of Wines: Or laſtly, by ſome noble <hi>Arcanum,</hi> whether ſpecifick or catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which doth readily purifie the blood, rejecting the feculencies: for the blood may long ferment, and yet through an innate weakneſs, ſtill retain the firſt feculencies: and unleſs helped by ſome <hi>Arcanum,</hi> would keep on fermenting, even unto the ruine of the balſamick principles thereof. Theſe refinning <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana's,</hi> or purifying Medicines, anſwer that which ſome ingenuous Wine-Coopers perform, by putting ſome peculiar thing into the Wines, which will lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely put a ſtop to the overworking of the Wines; but the skill of ſuch perſons is ſhewed herein, that what they put into the Wines, doth ſo ſpecifically (if I may call it) ſtay the overworking of the Wines, as that no prejudice ſucceeds upon the radical princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thereof, ſo as they are not liable thereby to decay or degenerate: ſo likewiſe by the skill of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, ſuch noble <hi>Arcana's,</hi> whether Specificks, or ſuch as are more univerſal in their depurating opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are to be adminiſtred, as may not only leaſurely put a ſtop to the overfermenting of the blood, but reſtore it to its equal temperature, and proportional poyſure of principles, thereby renewing its <hi>eucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and fortifying the balſam of life; But frequent Phlebotomizing, doth rob the blood of a great ſhare of thoſe remaining volatile balſamick Spirits, and therefore not proper for the reſtoration of its <hi>eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="42">42. Hence thoſe that recover under their hands, do it with much lingering and tediouſneſs, becauſe of the great enfeebling of their Spirits by loſs of blood, the very Weapon in the hand of Nature to manage its encounters with Diſeaſes; which is ſtrangely ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of its hands, by many of its pretended Friends,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41152:64"/>the Phyſitians; who, without pity, ſee her bleeding upon the ſpot, and cry out yet with flinty hearts, Blood, blood, yet more blood: Nay, after a ternary of bleedings, and as often vomitings and purgings, in an obſtinate Fever, which would neither bend to this ſevere method, nor the life make its <hi>exit</hi> thereby. One able Phyſitian being asked, What he would now do after all this? To which he ingenuouſly anſwered, That unleſs he run the ſame round again, he was at a ſtand, what to do further. The Querying perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, That he did believe, if he run but the ſame round over again, from the beginning to the end, the Patient would by that time be perfectly cured of all Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. I grant, That the ſingle breathing of a vein, or artery, or a moderate Phlebotomy, may, and doth ſometimes help in a Fever, where nothing of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is ſuſpected; and that chiefly upon the account of the ventilation of the blood, by which I mean a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at liberty that incoercible <hi>flatus,</hi> which is the product of the febrile fermentation in the veſſels of the blood; for this uncoagulable Spirit, or wild Gas, which alwayes reſults, and is the ſequel of a ſpurious fermentation, if it be not dinted, or let forth, either by breathing a vein, or by Diaphoreticks (which opening the pores, let it go at ſo many minute por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals) then it runs too and again in the veſſels of the blood, and cauſeth erratick pains, reſtleſsneſs, and unquietneſs of Spirits.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Therefore we find upon the ventilation of the blood, by a moderate Phlebotomy, that pains are abated, whether pluretick, or others; which the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts</hi> obſerving, take encouragement of arguing <hi>à minori ad majorem, viz.</hi> That if a little blood taking away, give ſome eaſe of pains, then ſurely the taking
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41152:65"/>away of a great deal, muſt give more eaſe; and ſo, if they would yet hold on their argument, the taking away of all the blood, will give perfect eaſe, not only from pains, but from all diſeaſes. Would they go no further than to argumentation, the Patient might very well bear with them; but they come to put this into action; they bleed once, its very well, I wiſh they would ſecond it with a Specifick; they ſtay not here, but go to it a ſecond and a third time, to the great loſs of Spirits, and enfeebling of the Patient; and oftentimes the diſeaſe as much, if not more to cure than ever, and the Patient left leſs capable of it.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. I confeſs I never order Phlebotomy oftner than once in a Fever; and that too, with reluctancy, bemoaning my ſelf, That I have not yet attained to a Medicine, that will anſwer all Indications thereof; for it is only our poverty of noble <hi>Arcana's,</hi> which makes us ſtoop to ſo low and trite a method: and yet I may be bold to affirm, That I have been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to cure Fevers of that nature, where the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> ſuppoſe moſt neceſſity of Blood-letting, even Pluriſies, by Specificks, without Phlebotomy. Nay, further, I have been with ſome Patients, who in Plure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies have undergone a Galenical method of twice blooding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (ready for the third time) and the Fever yet as high as at firſt; whom, after all this, I have, by the bleſſing of God, cured with a diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Specifick, once or twice repeated: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one ſingle Doſe thereof, hath ſo abated the pains, and allayed the feveriſhneſs, as that very little more hath been requiſite to the cure, <hi>Demptâ ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ pleurae infixâ per diaphoreticum ceſſat ipſa pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="46">46. As for the third and laſt Indication, <hi>viz.</hi> the fortification of the digeſtions and vital Spirits, Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41152:65"/>doth diametrically oppoſe, and that becauſe it robs the blood of part of its treaſure, ſurrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly ſtealing away its balſam; and therefore as I ſaid actually debilitates the vital Spirits, making them loure their Topſails upon a freſh incounter of the Diſeaſe: ſo that though ſeemingly the Diſeaſe may not aſſault ſo ſtrongly as before, it is not altogether through the abating the former force of the Diſeaſe, as it is from the weakening of the vital powers, who are not able to make as forcible an attempt, to expel the malady as before; and therfore flags before its enemy.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. As in acute ſo in Chronical Diſeaſes, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of Plebotomy is not commendable nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and that becauſe in long Diſeaſes the digeſtions being deprav'd, the blood (whoſe <hi>eucraſia</hi> depends upon the vigor thereof) becomes degenerated from its ſweet balſamick rubie eſſence, into an auſtere, ſharp, pontick or ſaltiſh liquor: which growing old for want of due fermentation and circulation, reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the veſſels, makes hetrogeneous coagulations, whence Pains, Tumors, Ulcers inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the common product of Chronical Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. So that what remains to be done in theſe chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Diſeaſes, is rather to ſuper-induce a new reviving ferment into theſe old decayed wines, the blood, that thereby new volatile Spirits might be ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and the ſweet balſamick eſſence be reſtored; then yet further to weaken by Phlebotomy the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vital Spirits: which if they could ſpeak, it would be <hi>Vox querebunda, manibus quorundum Medicorum tyrannicis gemens, Hinc lachrymae, viz.</hi> Faint cold ſweats; into which agony poor languiſhing Nature is often thrown, having both its ſtrength, firſt weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the continuance and prevalency of powerful Diſeaſes, and at laſt by the hand of its Phyſician
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41152:66"/>(who ſhould if rightly ſo, be its helper) to have its little ſtock of vital balſamick Spirits, waſted by a palpable weakner, Phlebotomy.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. Amongſt the moſt obvious ſymptomes, and to the Patient moſt urging, is that of thirſt; which becauſe it is not natural, the more they drink the more they would. This according to the <hi>Galenists,</hi> proceeds from an hot and dry Diſtemper of the ſtomach; to anſwer which indication, they moſt frequently or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cool and moiſt things: which if the cauſe of thirſt were as they ſuppoſe, they would have a moſt facile ready way of Cure, in caſe that were true, <hi>Contraria ſuis contrariis curantur; viz.</hi> That every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature were curable by its contrary; for then ſuppoſing ſuch and ſuch degree of heat and dryneſs of ſtomach in a Fever, it is but applying the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable degree of cooling and moiſtning liquors, and the Cure would forthwith be effected. If ſo, Why are not the thirſt in Fevers preſently quenched? That after great draughts of cooling Julips, and the like are drunke down, they yet cry out Drie, Drie, as thirſty after a while as ever.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. What? Can the elementary properties of cold and moiſt, ſo much conſpire the Patients prejudice, as to forget their own natures of cooling and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? Surely theſe qualities (if they may be ſo call'd) of heat and cold, of dryneſs and moiſture, muſt act one upon another upon the very contact; and no ſooner can heat be encountred with cold, but the heat muſt be abated; and if the degree of cold be proportionable, muſt become quite extinct: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can drineſs meet with moiſture in the like degree but the drineſs will ceaſe.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. So that indeed a Feveriſh thirſt hath not theſe elementary qualities for its efficient, and ſo is not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41152:66"/>curable by the contrary qualities; but hath a more abſtruſe cauſe, and that is from a depravation of the ferment of the ſtomack, which not being able to digeſt after the wonted manner, what is upon the ſtomach, turns it into recrement; which by the heat of the part (having loſt its curb the ferment) is burnt into a kind of <hi>Alkali</hi> or friable maſs, which being faſt impacted in the tunicles of the ſtomach, becomes the efficient cauſe of a <hi>febrile</hi> thirſt.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. Theſe burnt Alkalizate <hi>ſordes,</hi> parch the very membranous parts of the ſtomach, oeſophagus and tongue (which membrane, is but as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued web overſpreading all thoſe parts) thence the intollerable thirſt, foulneſs, roughneſs, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſs of the tongue, which by abſtinence from drink (as is the fooliſh cuſtome of ſome Phyſicians, who underſtand not the Diſeaſe, too ſtrictly prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit) the Fever becomes the more increaſed, the thirſt the ſtronger, and all the ſymptomes more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated. For there muſt be ſome liquid thing of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to dilute and ſoften theſe burnt <hi>ſordes,</hi> though it do not ſatisfie and quench the thirſt, or elſe all things go the worſe; but if the skill of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian be ſuch, as to mingle with theſe diluting pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liquids; ſomething to abſterſe theſe <hi>ſordes,</hi> and to ſatiate theſe Alkalizate recrements, then he effects ſomething as to the real quenching of thirſt, which otherwiſe proves obſtinate and rebellious to all ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple liquids.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. For if all ſimple water, or fermentally mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a vegetable juyce, <hi>viz.</hi> Beer, Ale, or Wine, be thrown into the ſtomach, upon theſe friable <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> they do but (and that ſcarcely) for a moment quench the thirſt, but by the untameable heat of the ſtomach; are caſt into vapours, and by ſweat
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41152:67"/>or inſenſibly, are driven through the pores of the body: and in the concluſion encreaſe the heat, cauſe cold ſweats, faintneſs, debilitudes and waſting laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, after the manner of water poured on an hot ſtone, is preſently diſperſed <hi>vapore tenus;</hi> or as Spirit of Wine poured upon an <hi>Alkali</hi> of Tartar, cauſeth a great heat, more than was before.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. But if theſe <hi>aduſt ſordes</hi> be abſters'd, by the well prepared Salt of Vitriol, or other proper eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; or ſome proper ſolutive, that may cleanſe downward the recrement of the primary digeſtions, and be ſeconded with Spirit of Salt, Sulphur or Vitriol, acuating the Patients common drink, together with the uſe of ſome anodynous Diaphoreticks, not only the thirſt will be abated and quenched, but the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh fermentation, and conſequently the Fever it ſelf. I have often wondred the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> ſhould not more ſeriouſly take into conſideration the efficacy of Diaphoreticks, or ſweating Medicines, in Fevers; in as much as in the whole round of their Practice, they find not a more effectual means to quench thirſt, and to abate a Fever, than by <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> which is moſt obvious both to them and to ordinary People, and yet there is nothing they leſs frequent. If it were no more than obſerving the operation of a Doſe of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> methinks it might convince them of the excellency of Diaphoreticks, and put them upon ingenuous enquiries, how they might promote, and improve that ſtock of Diaphoreticks, they have in the Shops; might I ſay put them upon enquiring, how a few grains of <hi>Laudanum</hi> ſhould ſo quiet the Spirits for a time, quench thirſt, and allay pains, and all this as a Diaphoretick; which ſurely if the narcotick Sulphur was caſtigated, and the power of the volatile Diaphoretick Salt thereof exalted,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41152:67"/>would prove a much more effectual Diaphoretick, than any <hi>Laudanum</hi> in the Shops.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. As for <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum,</hi> becauſe it is Chymical they are afraid of it; and if they order any, it is in ſo inconſiderable a quantity, as the effect cannot anſwer the Patients expectation. They will preſcribe 3 grains, it may be 4, 5, 6, or 7 grains, and a great Doſe too; and this forſooth muſt be clogg'd with ſome other farraginous mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which together makes ſuch a confus'd jumble upon the ſtomach, that the <hi>Archeus</hi> or vital regent, knows not what to make of it; for by their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they miſs the mark of Specificks, and thereby of the beſt Diaphoreticks: In effect, do nothing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, <hi>viz.</hi> without mixtures in the whole courſe of their Practice. They will wonder perhaps if I tell them that of this <hi>Antimonium Diaphoretick,</hi> which they ſcruple to give 6, 7 or 8 grains; I can and do with good ſucceſs, give from one ſcruple to an whole dragm, which is 60 grains, and that without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or danger, but with great ſatisfaction to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. <hi>Bezoardicum Minerale,</hi> another as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>anti-febrile</hi> Diaphoretick (as they account it) as the former, of which, they ſcarce dare give above 3, 4 or 5 grains; of which, I with the like ſucceſs as the former, give from half a ſcruple to 24 grains. Indeed they are both of my own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and therefore dare more confide in them.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. Now the concluſion of all this is, That Diaphoreticks whether Vegetable or Mineral, after a previous abſterſion of the primary digeſtions, are the only quenchers of thirſt, abaters of pains, allayers of Feveriſh fermentations, compoſers of the Spirits; and in fine, the chief Curers of Fevers: and therefore whether duely to be conſidered, let
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41152:68"/>the World judge, ſeeing it conſerves thouſands of Lives. Thus far as to particular Diaphoreticks. Beſides which, <hi>Helmont</hi> ſpeaks of an univerſal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphoretick or <hi>Panacea,</hi> by the name of <hi>Mercurius Precipitatus Diaphoreticus,</hi> which is a fixation of Precipitate, by the cohobating the <hi>Elementum ignis,</hi> extracted out of the Vitriol of <hi>Venus,</hi> at laſt being ſtrongly fired, becomes fixt, and is edulcorated by repeated diſtillations of rectified Spirit of Wine, from it to ten times, and then becomes ſweet; and is alſo called <hi>Aurum horizontale,</hi> of which he ſaith, <hi>Omnem ſan it febrem unicâ potione: Hecticam intra Lunae decurſum; oretenus enim ſumptus, curat carci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noma, lupum &amp; quodlibet eſt hominum cacoethes, ulcus ſive externum, ſive internum, itemque hydropem, Aſthma, &amp; Morbum quemcumque Chronicum; complet ſolus deſideria medentum tam in Phyſicis quàm Chirurgicis defectibus;</hi> by all which it may certainly be concluded to be a <hi>Panacea,</hi> in as much as (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what he affirms) it cures all acute and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Diſeaſes. <hi>Sed nobis non licet eſſe tam diſertos.</hi>

Secondly, The Dropſie may be helped by the <hi>Spaw;</hi> which to affirm, though at the firſt ſight it may ſeem unreaſonable and contradictory, becauſe in this Diſeaſe the blood is already too much diluted with a wateriſhneſs: yet if we conſider the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, which is chiefly an obſtruction of the Reins, the ſtrangeneſs will be taken away; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be a real vitiating of the ferment of the ſtomach, and an <hi>aeduſt Alkalizate ſordes</hi> impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the tunicles thereof, whence a Feveriſhneſs and a preſſing thirſt conſtantly attends Dropſical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which Fever is not primary but ſymptomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I ſay though the ground-work of this, as of moſt Diſeaſes, be in the ſtomach; yet is the main cauſe an obſtruction of the Reins, which being the principal emunctory of the potable parts of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive juyce, whether being ſeparable from the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41152:70"/>maſs of blood, by the emulgent veins, or by any other nearer paſſage to the Reins, if through the congeſtion of ſome <hi>mucous</hi> recrement, the ſmall veſſels are obſtructed (as uſually in this caſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) then is the ſuperfluous liquid <hi>latex</hi> (ready for ſeparation) regurgitated, either back into the maſs of blood, and thence into the habit of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whence that <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Dropſie, called <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarcaſis,</hi> which by the <hi>Anaſtomaſis</hi> of the veſſels, ſometimes lets a part thereof fall into the legs, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, eſpecially towards night; and at other times ſwallows them up again into the former veſſels, and the legs become unſwell'd again.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Or elſe the liquid potables, coming by a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cut to the Reins by reaſon of their obſtructions, flows back and is heaped up between the <hi>Omentum</hi> and <hi>Peritoneum;</hi> which ſtretching the membranes thereof, bears up ſtrongly againſt the <hi>Diaphragme,</hi> thereby contracting the cavity of the Lungs, makes the Patient ſhort-winded as commonly they are.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This congeſted potable <hi>latex,</hi> accompanyed with a <hi>flatus,</hi> gives being to a Tympany; and hath no urinous Salt in it, as that had which was about ſeparating from the blood, and by the obſtruction of the Veins flowed back again into the maſs: and therefore thoſe who are tapp'd for the Dropſie, let forth an almoſt inſipid liquor; ſo that water which paſſeth from thoſe who drinke plentifully of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> has no urinous Salt, and ſo neither tincture nor ſapour.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now the <hi>Spaw</hi> water doth notably cleanſe the ſtomach, firſt by looſning and diſſolving the cloſe ſitting <hi>ſordes;</hi> and that through the diſſolving pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the alumeniſh Mineral Salt, which gradually attenuates and thins the <hi>viſcous</hi> recrements of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41152:70"/>ſtomach, after which ſolution of the otherwiſe fixt feculencies of the ſtomach, the plentiful gulping of the water, doth eaſily waſh it away by ſtool; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, a great quantity of the water acuated with its Mineral Eſſurine Salt, paſſeth the ſhort way to the Reins, I mean by thoſe chanels, that great drinkers of Wine, and Strong Drink, have to convey away, ſuddainly, the potulent parts (of what they take in) to the Reins; whereby the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrative power of the Eſſurine Salt, which as a Solvent in the water, diſſolves the coagulated matter, opens the obſtructions, and makes free paſſage both for it ſelf, and for the <hi>exit</hi> of the reſtagnating <hi>latex,</hi> which before floted in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and ſwell'd the belly.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That obſtruction of the Reins is the chief, if not the eſſential cauſe, of the ſuper-abundant floting of the potable parts in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; becauſe all Dropſical Perſons piſs very little, and that often with difficulty: ſo that the moſt part of that which ſhould paſs forth by urine, through obſtructions regurgitates back upon the bowels, or elſe fills the bloody veſſels with a dilating over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus <hi>latex;</hi> whereas if the paſſages were open, and the current kept clear, all the ſuperfluous watry parts, would be dreined away by their natural and proper chanels, and ſo all would be well.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The <hi>Spaw</hi> therefore hath its efficacy in Cure of the Dropſie two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by abſterſing the <hi>ſordes</hi> of the digeſtions, and by being a Diuretick; not to ſay that in ſome obſtinate Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, there may be an extravaſated blood about the Reins, which may ſo irritate the innate Spirit of thoſe parts, as to make a ſpontaneous occluſion of the veſſels, and reſiſt all Medicines, except the nobleſt of Chymical <hi>Arcana's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:41152:71"/>12. Thoſe Medicines which chiefly relate to the Cure of the Dropſie are, as I ſaid, ſuch as are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſive, and diuretick, together with ſuch as have a reſtorative aſtringency, communicable to the debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated membranous parts; of which ſort are the lixivial Salts of Vegetables, whether of Broom, Juniper, the Vine, Wormwood, or the like (among which there is ſmall difference) wherewith the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary drink of the Patient is to be acuated: alſo the <hi>Cinnabar</hi> of Antimony often reſublim'd, the Spirit of Salt of Tartar; the <hi>ſaccharum Martis</hi> or Sugar of Steel; <hi>Bezoardicum Minerale,</hi> which is <hi>Riverius</hi> his Diaphoretick out of the Butter of Antimony; the <hi>Pilulae lunares;</hi> of which laſt, I muſt confeſs, I never found any conſiderable ſucceſs, and for the ſake of the corroding <hi>Aqua fortial</hi> or nitrous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſhall for the future rather adviſe againſt, than otherwiſe; alſo the magiſtery of Wine, which is the fixt Salt of Tartar ſo prepared, as to diſſolve in the moſt rectified <hi>alcool</hi> Spirit of Wine; which being often purified by reduction, is a noble Diuretick, eſſential Salt of Tartar; alſo the <hi>Precipitatus Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorcticus,</hi> and <hi>Precipiolum Paracelſi;</hi> the ſappy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of the Birch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For moſt of which Medicines, if you conſult the diſpenſatory, you will be miſtaken; they are not attained to by idleneſs, and meer ſpeculation, but by boldly handling the coals, and putting our fingers into fire.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. The next Diſeaſe is the Stone and Strangury; upon which the <hi>Spaw</hi> hath the more efficacy, becauſe a great part of the water glides through the Reins and Bladder, the places where Gravel and the Stone have their nativity; ſo that firſt by the abſterſive vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Eſſurine Salt in the water, it hinders the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41152:71"/>encreaſe of growth of the bulk of the Stone, by carrying away the recremental <hi>ſordes</hi> of thoſe parts, alſo by often drinking and that too great quantities of the water, it keeps the current open, dilates the paſſages, and takes the opportunity of ſlipping a Stone now and then, with a ſtream of water, through the <hi>ſphincter</hi> of the Bladder.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But as to a reſolution of the Stone, into a liquid juyce, by a retrograde <hi>Analyſis,</hi> is not feaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either by this or any other Spring; but only (at leaſt chiefly competible to the Alkaheſtical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the <hi>Ludus Paracelſi, calculoſorum Sola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men magnum;</hi> of which, is the <hi>Alkaheſt</hi> diſtilled from the <hi>Ludus,</hi> by which the <hi>Ludus</hi> is reduc'd into a Salt, diſſolvable in the Air into a Liquor; this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in a ſealed glaſs, until the Salt ſwim upon the top of the attracted moiſture, in the form of a greeniſh Oyl or <hi>Axungia,</hi> of which Fourteen Grains ſometimes repeated reſolves the compage of the Stone, of what magnitude ſoever; and upon the ſolution, is alſo expelled; and thereby the Stone perfectly Cured, according to the proceſs of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> who both (as they ſay) had it: by which, as <hi>Helmont</hi> reports, not only the Stone was reduced into a liquid form, and driven forth; but alſo the <hi>inclinatio petrifica</hi> was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I have by a ſuccedaneal Preparation, ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the body of the <hi>Ludus,</hi> as that it would yield a deep ſaturate green tincture to Spirit of Salt, as alſo to another liquor of Salt I have by me; but what that will effect, as to the Stone, I have not yet tryed. The well prepared Spirit of Salt, <hi>Helmont</hi> highly commends for the Strangury, and the <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctura Aroph Paracelſi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. The Jaundiſe if not too deeply graduated
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41152:72"/>into that called the Black, is alſo curable by the <hi>Spaw;</hi> and that becauſe this Diſeaſe proceeds from an error of Crudities in the ſecond digeſtion, tranſmitted into the fifth or habit of the body; where that which ſhould of due have been ſeparated by the right fermentation in the ſecond digeſtion, was carryed into the laſt digeſtion, and there diſcoloured the blood in the ultimate <hi>fibres,</hi> through the whole habit of the body: Now the <hi>Spaw,</hi> as I ſaid, helps to ſeparate, that which of due ought to be ſeparated; by opening the obſtructions of the ſecond digeſtion, and ſo may prevent the feeding of the Diſeaſe, from its own original ſcource, and by the help of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks may thoroughly be Cured; of which ſort, are <hi>Ens Veneris,</hi> Spirit of Urine, <hi>Alkalies, mille pedes aliaeque inſectae, quae abſter gunt ſecundam dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. Now come we to Hypocondriack Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, A Diſeaſe when deeply ſeated, puzzles the <hi>Spaws,</hi> and the beſt method of uſual Medicines. The place of its nativity is probably the Spleen, whoſe ferment if vigorous, is not only to make a ſeparation of ſome impurities of the blood, not ſeparable by any other part: but alſo as a ſpecifical ferment, to add ſome new and noble qualities to the blood, making it more pure and ſpiritous by ſeparating the feculencies thereof, promoting the clarity of the <hi>Regimen</hi> of the animal Spirits, that Looking-glaſs of the Soul, which if pure and polite, gives pleaſure and ſolace to the Soul in the Body, cauſing generous reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſhaping perſpicacious Idea's, helping acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fancy, ſolidity of judgement, and tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of memory.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Whereas if the fermental elaboration of the blood in the Spleen be deficient; and thereby the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41152:72"/>
                     <hi>ſordes</hi> become unſeparated: thence a ſteam ariſeth which ſoyls the veſſels and muds the animal Spirits, darkens the imaginative part, and with a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vapour clouds the fancy, Hence all the irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſturbed fancies of Hypochondriack Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly:</p>
                  <p n="18">18. The Spleen and the regiment thereof, is <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>'s Shop, where the materials lie for forging of all Idea's; if the materials be good and artificially hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a ſound ſtructure of fancy may well be raiſed: but if a wrong caſt happen, either through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of the materials, I mean the blood, or through the error of the work-man, I mean the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſtructure will prove accordingly, <hi>viz.</hi> the fancy will be inverted, and the Idea's thereof become prepoſterous.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Now the meat and drink we commonly take, together with the exorbitancies thereof, have no ſmall influence upon the Spleen, and its oeconomy, and conſequently upon the animal Spirits and the Soul,
<q>
                        <l>—Corpus onuſtum</l>
                        <l>Heſternis vitiis, animum quoque praegravat unâ</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if a good orderly Diet be obſerved, of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food, with much temperance and moderation, Chronical Diſeaſes cannot have power to exerciſe that tyranny they uſually do, nor can the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the digeſtions prove ſo irreducible, as they do by exceſs of living; in as much as all the digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons take their nutritive juyce in order one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as if the firſt prove a glutton overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging its ferment, the reſt ſhare with the exceſs, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41152:73"/>communicate it one to another, till it hath gone the round, and in the concluſion reach thoſe Spirits, whoſe fine texture makes them nearer the Soul, by which it alſo becomes affected.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. The <hi>Spaw</hi> hath power to help the carrying of the dreggy parts, left after the digeſtion of the ſtomach is over; and thereby helps the refining of the veſſels, ſo as the nutritive juyce, may not come replete with crudities to the other ſubſequent digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo ſubducts from the Diſeaſe by hindring the affluent cauſe: for ſo far as the virtue of the Eſſurine Salt in the water can reach, eſpecially in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon paſſages towards the bladder, it doth pretty well cleanſe and therefore proves effectual in thoſe Diſeaſes, native to thoſe parts; but doth ſcarce through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penetrate thoſe more abſtruſe receſſes, where the main concerns of animal Spirits and the forging of Idea's are tranſacted. This is left for the other more penetrating Medicines to perform, which perhaps one with the other, may the better complete the Cure.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. The Medicaments of uſe in this caſe, are ſuch as are abſterſive, of a penetrating nature, oppoſe a <hi>flatus</hi> by allaying the ſpurious fermentation, and can dulcifie the blood and humours, by all which compoſing the Spirits and ſettling every thing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; of which ſort are a <hi>Tartarum vitriolatum,</hi> not ſuch a one as is vulgarly made in the Shops, with Oyl of Vitriol: but with the Eſſurine Salt of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol, that hath not undergone any force of fire, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolvable in any <hi>Vehicle,</hi> which the other will not. The Eſſential Salt of Tartar, the <hi>Sal Chalybis,</hi> the Spirit of Salt of Tartar, the <hi>Spiritus Veneris,</hi> Coral and Crabs-Eyes; and probably above all the <hi>Aurum Horizontale,</hi> or fixt <hi>Mercury,</hi> which being a <hi>Panacea</hi> anſwers all Indications.</p>
                  <p n="22">
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:41152:73"/>22. Now come we to diſcourſe of Womens Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and of the virtue of the <hi>Spaw</hi> in the Cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; whoſe Diſeaſes proceed chiefly from obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Matrix, whereby the redundant blood flows back, or from a debilitude of the Womb, whereby the blood becomes dreyn'd away in too great quantities; whence <hi>Lypothymia's,</hi> Faintings and Swoonings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. As to the obſtructions of the ſuperfluous blood, which ſhould be carryed away by the veſſels of the Matrix, in form of the <hi>Menſes:</hi> We muſt know therefore, that the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> are a certain portion or effloreſcence of the blood, granted by God in nature for proper ends, <hi>viz.</hi> both for yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding matter and corporeal bulk to the <hi>foetus</hi> or <hi>embryo</hi> in the Womb; as alſo for nouriſhment of the ſame, until it come to the birth, It is I ſay a certain porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blood remaining after a full refection of the body, ingendred within a Lunar Moneth, and ſequeſtred from the reſt of the maſs to the foreſaid end; this matter deſtined to the generation and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the <hi>foetus,</hi> long foreſeen of Nature (which never acts in vain <hi>quoad intentionem</hi>) in the female, is the main drift and aim of the <hi>Menſtrues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. The manner of their generation is thus, <hi>viz.</hi> The blood in the intermitting time, encreaſeth in its bulk in the Veins and Arteries, ſo that one part thereof being ſuppoſed to ſupply the deficiency of what is daily ſpent by tranſpiration, the ſuperfluous part increaſeth the maſs of blood, and at length ſtretcheth the containing veſſels with its plenty, whence a <hi>tungeſcence</hi> and <hi>plethory</hi> of the veſſels.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Then Nature (not unmindful of its office) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours at the next critical Lunar ſeaſon, to employ a little the <hi>turgid</hi> veſſels, by certain paſſages and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41152:74"/>
                     <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> from the veſſels they run in before, into the <hi>ſecundines</hi> or chanels of the Matrix. This <hi>niſus</hi> or endevour is done two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> both by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertion of the <hi>Anaſtomoſis</hi> from ſome veſſels into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as alſo by an innate contraction of the <hi>fibres</hi> of the ſanguinary veſſels, by which they endevour to free themſelves <hi>(annuente natura)</hi> from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing <hi>Plethora;</hi> for there is a certain contraction or compreſſion, proper to the Veins and Arteries, by which the circulation of the blood and nutrition of the ſolid parts ſucceeds the better: ſo that thoſe veſſels have a kind of connate <hi>Syſtole,</hi> by which they compreſs themſelves, and after their wonted manner, become free from the ſtifling plenty of blood.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. That there is a <hi>Turgeſcence</hi> of the veſſels about the time deſign'd by Nature, for the critical evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is manifeſt in Virgins, Widows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom ſuch a compreſſion of the veins, and ſuch an apertion of the <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> of the veſſels are at the critical menſtrual ſeaſon denyed; <hi>oculare praebent teſtimonium defectuum naturalium; ſignaque in fronte gerunt aliquid amplius in venis ac arteriis adeſſe;</hi> Whence ſometimes <hi>Puſtules</hi> in the Face, Redneſs of Eyes, with a ſwelling of the circumjacent veins; whence alſo Tumors in ſeveral parts of the body, Pain in the head and other parts; and many other Diſeaſes, which owe their original to no other than this eſſential cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. All which indicate a <hi>Plethory</hi> or <hi>Turgeſcence</hi> through overmuch plenty of blood, whence the maſs of blood through a diſtention of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the veſſels; doth as it were reſtagnate therein; eſpecially in the <hi>Bronchy's</hi> of the Lungs, where the blood ſetting (as the vulgar word is) and the motion of the <hi>Diaphragme</hi> being unproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41152:74"/>towards its agile tranſmiſſion into other parts, and that by reaſon of the Laxation and flagging of the membranes thereof, over-charged with too great afflux of blood; Whence an Indiſpoſition, Dulneſs, and Sluggiſhneſs of the body, Shortneſs of Breath, an oppreſſion of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> or upper mouth of the ſtomach, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> And in a further degree of this reſtagnation or ſetting of the blood, proceeds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Syncopes,</hi> Palpitations and Suffocations; yea at length Death it ſelf. And all this from a bare ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary reſtagnation of the blood in the veſſels, through a retention of that which ſhould naturally be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated at its due critical ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Now further if the blood upon theſe reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reſtagnate about the mouths of the veſſels of the Matrix; eſpecially if tainted with any virulency, from the reflux of ſome corrupt Menſtrual blood, whoſe current hath been ſtopped by cold paſſion, or the like, at the very time of Critical evacuation: thence the <hi>Archeal Regimen</hi> of the Matrix, that <hi>Animal furibundum,</hi> becomes rouz'd up, which acts at a diſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> in other remote parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by that manner of operation which <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> calls a <hi>Blaſs alterativum,</hi> which I cannot nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer compareto any other than to the <hi>ſpiritus ſylveſtris,</hi> or <hi>flatus incoercibilis</hi> mentioned before, yet is not formally the ſame,</p>
                  <p n="29">29. It is an influential manner of acting, which I judge to be <hi>Identical,</hi> with that whereby the Soul acts upon the Body by paſſion, darting a Raye here or there, upon this part or the other, <hi>ad lubitum;</hi> for this influential <hi>Blaſs</hi> (or what other name we may give it, ſo it comprehend the nature of the thing) it exerciſeth its tyranny on remote parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hypochonders, Stomach, Lungs, Brain,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41152:75"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by violent forcible motions, and tenſions of the Hypochonders (enough to require the ſtrength of two or three men ſometimes to keep down) and by cauſing the blood to reſtagnate in the Lungs and Heart; whence a ceſſation of the Pulſe, and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the blood, alſo an inſtantaneous Aſthma, together with a ceſpitation of the animal Spirits, accompanyed ſometimes with a <hi>contorſion</hi> of ſome <hi>muſculous</hi> parts; whence Convulſions and the like: in the concluſion it puts a ſtop to all the digeſtions and functions of the body, ſave its own and that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Theſe <hi>Hyſterical</hi> paroxyſms are often occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally brought on by paſſions in thoſe women incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thereto; which like as a Feveriſh <hi>Delirium,</hi> imitates the <hi>narcotick</hi> Sulphur of <hi>Opium,</hi> or rather as the animal Spirits, are identically wrought upon by a Fever, as by a large Doſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> both working the ſame effect, perverting the imaginative faculty, cauſing wandring irregular Phantaſms, and ſudden irrational Idea's, with prepoſterous glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the operation of the one ſcarce diſtinguiſhable from the other: So in like manner the uterine <hi>Archeus</hi> or <hi>Spiritus impetum faciens,</hi> connatural to that part, is equally irritated and provoked by a paſſion of the mind, as by a virulency from regur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated foetid Menſtrual blood, recurring upon the innocent maſs thereof, in thoſe I mean inclinable to theſe <hi>Hyſterical</hi> Fits.</p>

This flatulent <hi>Blaſs</hi> of the uterine <hi>Archeus,</hi> is far more prevalent than the Elaſtick power of the air; for if the trite notion were true, That the Fits of the Mother were from a bare windineſs of the Womb, which rowls up the <hi>Abdomen</hi> to the Hypochonders, puffs and ſwells up the parts; then muſt the Womb be ſuppoſed as a Pneumatick Engine, out of which the air being exhauſted (how or by what means I know not) the air of the convex part muſt of nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſity have a ſtrong preſſure or Elaſtick force to return into the concave thereof, to ſupply the forced va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy: ſo that the preſſure would not be ſo much from the Womb as towards it, unleſs at the time of the ſuction of the air. Which ſuppoſe we grant, yet would the external preſſure of the air be as ſtrong to return into its vacant and deſerted cavity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by force the membranous parts of the Matrix to give way, flag and falk before it, till it came to an equal poyſe again; and ſo no forcible wind would thence preſs the adjacent parts to any ſuch injury, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the uterine <hi>flatus</hi> doth.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. So that, let them contrive all the ways ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, how to ſolve all the urgent <hi>Phoenomena's</hi> of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41152:76"/>this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> grounded upon a ſolitary <hi>flatus;</hi> which according to the ordinary acceptation, is only a <hi>latio</hi> or <hi>motus aeris,</hi> and we ſhall find a flaw in them; for as ſuch, though forced with Engines in the body (which we know not how they can prove) yet cannot perform, neither with that clerity nor force, what the otherwiſe violent operative <hi>Blaſs</hi> of the Matrix can ſuddainly diſplay, even <hi>ictu oculi.</hi> For as a blaſt or malignant influence in the chanels or <hi>peroledi</hi> of the air, doth ſuddainly ſmite and wither branches of Trees, or other Fruits of the earth, or Faces of People, where they hit; ſo <hi>(quanquam hand paſſibus equis)</hi> where this malevolent influential <hi>Blaſs</hi> or incoercible <hi>flatus</hi> of the Womb hits, thoſe parts are afflicted with the raging force thereof.

In order to which, if <hi>Sal Martis, viz.</hi> the Sugar of Steel, or the <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> or Powder of Steel it ſelf, be given after a due manner; as ſoon as they come into the ſtomach, the Salt of Steel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a <hi>Vehicle,</hi> whether water or wine, the <hi>Crocus</hi> therein contained precipitates, unto which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſpurious excrementitious Salt haſts, becomes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated thereon; and carryed away by ſeidge: whence the blackneſs of excrements in thoſe who take chalibeate Medicines.

                  <p n="37">37. Now becauſe in the <hi>Spaw</hi> water there is no <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> no body of Iron at all, but only a ſleight touch of the <hi>minera</hi> thereof, I ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, for helping the waters to work this effect, to diſſolve therein at ſometimes half a ſcruple or more of rightly prepared Sugar of Steel, which no doubt would make the water more effectual, for preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating and carrying away this foreſaid <hi>Tartarum ſolutum,</hi> which otherwiſe often pertinaciouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to the veſſels, and proves rebellious to ordinary ſolutives or purging Medicines; to which purpoſe ſome vitrioline waters, eſpecially where a larger por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body of Iron is diſſolved, is of more
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41152:77"/>efficacy in this caſe than, this: which as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may eaſily be helped, by an artificial addition. For commonly in the moſt obdurate obſtructions and Diſeaſes thence depending, this <hi>Sal excrementitium</hi> clings cloſely to the oſculations of the veſſels, and is the cauſe why the Green-Sickneſs in ſome young women is ſo difficult to Cure. Which ſometimes bends not to the ſingle help of this or other <hi>Spaws,</hi> where little or no body of a Mineral is found: nor to a <hi>Galenical</hi> method of Blooding, Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only or chiefly to chalibeate Medicines, and ſome reſolving penetrating Diaphoreticks.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. In the defects of Critical evacuations in young women, the obſtructions may be ſo great, as to cauſe an uterine Aſthma, Suffocation, Epilepſie, Palſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which obſtructions being removed by the <hi>Spaws</hi> and chalibeate Medicines, thoſe Diſeaſes becauſe uterine, and depending thereon, are forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Cured; to which the change of Air doth not a little contribute, by adding a volatizing ferment to the blood, whereby it becomes more capable of being abſolv'd from the tartareous recrement, to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the more freely in the veſſels.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. As the <hi>Spaw</hi> water and chalibeate Medicines, have an aperient virtue of refolving the tartareous obſtruent: ſo alſo they ſtrengthen and conſtringe the fibrous <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the Membranous parts, helping them to do their work which before they flagged under; hence they are proper for <hi>Diarrhea's, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteria's, Lienteria's, Coeliaca's, &amp;c.</hi> All which proceeding from a coagulation of the foreſaid tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareous recrement upon the <hi>fibres</hi> of the Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous parts, which makes them forget their functions, weakens and looſens the <hi>fibres,</hi> whereby they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not retain what they ſhould, but carries all off with

                  <head>A ſhort Deſcription of <hi>Malton Spaw.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe like Ingredients of the <hi>Scarborough Spaw,</hi> hath alſo the <hi>Spaw</hi> at <hi>Malton,</hi> and conſequently according to all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility the ſame operation; as to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Mineral Ingredients, will appear, if you put either the powder or ſolution of Gauls thereto, it preſently gives an opacity, firſt purple, then black; after the manner as the ſame doth to the <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> water, or to a ſolution of Allom ſtone, into which if Spirit or Oyl of Vitriol be dropt, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Malton Spaw</hi> as well as the reſt will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come clear again: If Oyl of Tartar be dropt into the ſame cleared water, it becomes troubled again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Oyl of Tartar be dropt into ſome freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Malton Spaw,</hi> it makes a white <hi>Coagulum</hi> or milky ſeparation, diſperſed through the whole; if Oyl of Vitriol be dropt into that milk water, it clears it after a little ebullition from the two contrary Salts. The ſame <hi>Spaw</hi> with the addition of the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſpirit of Harts-horn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes a white ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with Oyl of Vitriol becomes clear.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This water I have diſtilled in a glaſs-Retort, with a gentle fire; and after the ſimple elementary water was come off, there remained a pale-coloured Sediment, much the ſame with that which remains after the diſtillation of the <hi>Scarborough Spaw, viz.</hi> an Eſfurine alumeniſh Salt, which paſſing thorough or by ſome Mineral Bed of Iron, licks upon it, carries ſome ſmall touches thereof; and alſo paſſing by ſome Stones in its current, raiſeth ſome ſmall portion thereof, which being wrought off by the Eſſurine
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41152:78"/>Salt, it hides it with it ſelf in the pores of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which is that as remains after the Salt is waſht from this Sediment, either ſimply or after calcinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath no taſte, nor (after the ſeparation of the Salt) is diſſolvable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To enumerate the virtues thereof, were but to repeat what I have ſaid already concerning the <hi>Scarborough Spaw;</hi> and therefore ſhall wave it, and wiſh a ſtronger Spring, with a better current, were endevoured thereabout, for the good of that part of the Country; in reſpect it hath but a faint Spring, and would eaſily be dreyned if many ſhould drink thereat. This water is as deeply ſaturate with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Principles, and as throughly impregnate with Eſſurine Alumeniſh Salt, as the other of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> only by reaſon of the reſtagnation of the water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the mouth of the Spring, is ſomewhat more ſluggiſh, and unapt to give its virtue: All which may be mended to the great improvement thereof, if a new Spring were found out.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. I Shall not ſpeak much of this water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ingenuous Dr. <hi>French</hi> hath writ thereof at large; only ſhall in ſhort ſay, That this water hath but a ſmall portion of an Eſſurine Acidity, which hath a little preyed upon the <hi>Minera</hi> of Iron, got a ſleight touch therefrom, and therein is as a Vitriol of the <hi>Minera</hi> of Iron.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For if Gauls be put therein, it turns purple, and in the concluſion Inky, upon which if Oyl of Vitriol be dropt, it becomes clear again; and by Oyl of Tartar muddied, and cleared again with Oyl of Vitriol, <hi>Aqua fortis, &amp;c.</hi> But if you pour Oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar on ſome of the freſh water, it gives a white milky ſeparation; which with Oyl of Vitriol becomes, after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bullition, clear again; upon which if Oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, Spirit of Harts-horn, or any volatile Saline Spirit be again poured, it cauſeth the ſame white <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulum,</hi> reducible to a clarity by freſh addition of the foreſaid Oyl of Vitriol, <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or the like.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All which demonſtrate, That Vitrioline Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may undergo the ſame alterations, by the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; of various Liquors, as Alumeniſh Solutions will do, and that in effect, as I at large ſhewed in the former Diſcourſe, are but the ſame Mineral Eſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Salt, under various diſguiſes from Mineral Beds, where they become ſpecificated into this or the other Salt, from the touching upon various Mineral Glebes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So that in effect, all Mineral Springs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vitrioline or aluminous, are the ſame; only ſome waters are more ſtrongly ſaturated with Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Salts than others: in order to which, we find
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41152:79"/>that the <hi>Scarborough</hi> and <hi>Malton</hi> water are better fraught, and more richly laden with its Minerals than this of <hi>Knarsborough,</hi> which is a more poor lean water, thin of Minerals, and therefore greater quantities muſt be drunke.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I confeſs I like the Air of that place much better, being upon an high heathy Common, than that of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> eſpecially for weak and tender bodies; and in the Cure of Chronical Diſeaſes, the choiceneſs of the Air is of no ſmall value, nay indeed oftentimes <hi>inſtar omnium,</hi> above all the reſt. For the change of the Air, and the aptneſs and goodneſs thereof, doth often volatize the ſluggiſh ferment of the blood, which in long continued Chronical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, as the Scurvy, Dropſie, Aſthma, Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Cachexia's, &amp;c.</hi> is become flat, feculent and reſtagnant in the veſſels, through the depravation of the ferment thereof; which cauſeth the lamp of Life, only to glow in the coal, or <hi>Caput mort</hi> of the blood: whence they commonly, who are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with thoſes Diſeaſes, go heavily and ſadly.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whereas when the ferment of the blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes reſtored (to which change of Air doth not a little contribute) that it ſeparates the feculencies, volatizeth the maſs, and gives wings to that which ſhould tranſpire, then the blood begins to circulate freely, the Diſeaſes become Cured, and the lamp of Life burns with a bright flame. I ſay, the change of Air helping to volatize the blood, renders it more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving ſome aſſiſtance by other Remedies, whether the <hi>Spaw</hi> water or other Specificks.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That this <hi>Spaw</hi> is Vitrioline, and that only, is demonſtrable by matter of fact, <hi>viz.</hi> Take a Dram of Vitriol of Iron, otherwiſe called Salt of Steel, which diſſolve in a pint of Spring water; of which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41152:80"/>two or three ſpoonfuls mixed with a glaſs of freſh Spring water, gives the exact taſte of that <hi>Spaw.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. I ſhould adviſe the Drinkers of that <hi>Spaw,</hi> in order to make the waters more effectual in leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, to take Salt of Steel diſſolv'd therein frequently; which I am confident, would add abundantly to its virtue, and make it more readily anſwer their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For thereby, firſt, they need not drink ſuch large quantities, which often overchargeth the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, ſtretcheth the Hypochonders, and burdens nature, to the prejudice of the expected future good; whereas a leſſer quantity acuated, with an artificial Vitriol or Salt of Steel, will make its way the more readily, open obſtructions more powerfully, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringe the looſe flagging membranous parts more eaſily, and anſwer all indications more generally.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Beſides all which, the <hi>Crocus</hi> of the Steel in that Vitriol, when taken into the Stomach <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would precipitate; upon which the excrementitious Salt or Tartarous recrement, the great obſtructer in many Diſeaſes, would be coagulated, and by the periſtaltick motion of the Inteſtines would be carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off by ſiedge, giving blackneſs to the excrements, thereby ſweetning the blood and hurnours.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And therefore it is that thoſe Mineral Springs, which are the moſt impregnate with a natural Vitriol of Iron, are not only reputed but found to be the moſt ſucceſsful in Cures, witneſs the two <hi>German Spaws, Pawhont</hi> and <hi>Sanvenir,</hi> or <hi>Savern,</hi> in which, though Dr. <hi>Heeres</hi> ſaith, That by diſtillation he found Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, <hi>Oker</hi> and a little Vitriol, I mean in the <hi>Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hom;</hi> yet if we ſhall credit <hi>Helmont</hi> he ſpeaks thus, <hi>Diſtillari aliquando ſeriò, Savenirium &amp; Pawhonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; &amp; ſanè non tantum Mineralium catalogum, imò nil quicquam in iis offendi, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  <p n="11">11. By the <hi>Medium</hi> of which Vitriol of Iron thoſe Springs effected their Cures: Of which alſo this at <hi>Knarsborough,</hi> if aſſiſted by the help of an artificial Vitriol or Salt of Steel, would prove <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedancous;</hi> though I confeſs if it were ſaturate with the natural Vitriol, it would operate the better. Which, whether natural or artificial, if the water be any thing conſiderably impregnate therewith, it doth its work in leſs quantities; the great bulk whereof, uſually taken to make it work, ſtretcheth too much the <hi>Fibers</hi> of the Membranous parts, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffles their <hi>Syſtole</hi> or contractive motion; whence not being ſtrengthened afterwards by ſome aſtringents, they flag, and the Patients ſometimes, after they have left drinking the waters, fall into Dropſies, Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Rheumes, <hi>Cachexia's,</hi> and the like.</p>

I ſhould adviſe before the drinking of the water, a Doſe or two of the well prepared Salt of Vitriol, eſpecially to ſuch whoſe ſtomachs are furr'd with a tartarous recrement, and <hi>viſcous</hi> Sediment, faſt impacted in the tunicles thereof, which the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary waters might ſlip over again and again, without any remove, and conſequently without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effect; but being once looſened by the ſtrength of an Emetick, might be carryed off the ſtomach, partly upwards and the reſt downwards, waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the force of the water.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The time of drinking the largeſt Doſe of the waters, acuated with the Salt of Steel, is the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, walking as the uſual courſe is, and no more all the day, except two glaſſes in the Afternoon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four of the Clock; and that but to ſome bodies neither, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſuch as by experiment find it go well with them: exerciſing themſelves by Walking, Riding, Reading, Bowling, or any other innocent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement; keeping an ordinary Diet of a few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and thoſe of wholeſom meat and well cook'd, without too much variety of ſauces, which confounds the ſtomach; not to glut or overcharge the ſtomach, but to keep an hanke over it.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The water thus drunke, together with the addition of ſome ſingular Specificks, well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according as the nature of the Diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, will probably, <hi>conſideratis conſiderandis,</hi> perform very conſiderable Cures, to the comfort of the Patient and credit of the Phyſician; who as ſuch, is a Miniſter or helper of Nature.

                  <head>The Sulphur Well at <hi>Knarsborough.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. THat this water hath a ſtrong body of <hi>Sal Marine</hi> in it, needs no further e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement than its eminent ſaltiſh taſte, and the copiouſneſs of a black ſalt left behind after the diſtillation, or evaporation of the water; which by ſolution, filtration and evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on becomes a clean white <hi>Sal Marine,</hi> no way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable from the Trencher-ſalt we uſe; that it hath alſo a Sulphureous <hi>foetidneſs,</hi> is apparent enough, both by the ſmell, and by the ſtrong rifts or belches upon the ſtomach, ſomewhat like to <hi>foetid</hi> rotten Eggs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As I was trying an Experiment to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I found ſomewhat unexpectedly, which did abundantly ſatisfie me, as to the cauſe and reaſon of this Spring; and it was thus, I took three Ounces of thrice calcin'd Bay Salt, diſſolv'd it in about a pint of, Well water, which upon the Solution gave a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>foetid</hi> odour, moſt exactly reſembling this Sulphur Well. It was very black in reſpect of the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreity of the Salt that gave that blackneſs to the otherwiſe clear water; this I filtred forthwith into a clear liquor, that retain'd the perfect ſmell and taſte of the Sulphur water.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whence I concluded, firſt, That the <hi>Sal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> is not a ſimple Salt, but a Mineral Concrete, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an embryonate Sulphur cloſe lockt up in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion or compage of its body, whereby the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Ens Salium</hi> becomes ſhut up in it, as well as in other Mineral Salts; and therefore cannot be made to appear, unleſs that which hinders be taken away, that is, unleſs the Hydropick moiſture wherewith it abounds be exhauſted by flagration or decrepitation,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41152:82"/>and the terreſtrious feculency, or (as I would rather call it) the embryonated <hi>foetid</hi> Sulphur be removed, which is done by a further, or reiterate calcination or fuſion by the fire, whereby its Mineral compage is unloos'd, and ſo comes nearer its <hi>Primum Ens,</hi> than when it's clothed with Mineral Veſtments.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For all Mineral Salts, whether Nitre, Allom, Vitriol, or <hi>Sal Marine,</hi> are but the ſeveral ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated concretions of that <hi>Primum Ens Salium,</hi> the mother of them, as alſo of other Mineral producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So that the <hi>Primum Ens</hi> runs through, and is in all thoſe Salts, only receives a particular determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into this or the other Salt, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domination of the properties of the nature and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the place, at time of concretion; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that by the addition of a Sulphur, every where (though differently) wrapt up in the boſome of Nature, this <hi>Primum Ens</hi> becomes coagulated and determined into a different Salt, or other concrete bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (which yet to a common and unexperienced eye, might eaſily paſs for a ſimple and uncompounded Salt) the reſolution of which requires no leſs than a skilful Artiſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Secondly, I hence alſo conclude, What may be the conſtitutive principles of Sulphureous Springs; and that is a <hi>Sal Marine,</hi> ſo digeſted in the bowels of the Earth, as that its Mineral embryonated Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur becomes unlooſed: which together diſſolving in the vein of a Spring, paſſing through the various Meanders or Streiners of the Earth, called by <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont Sabulum bulliens</hi> or <hi>Quellem,</hi> it becomes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from much of its terreſtrial feculency it had contracted in its ſolution.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By which embryonated Sulphur, I mean a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur <hi>in ſuis principiis,</hi> in its firſt appearance, whilſt it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41152:83"/>is yet in the kernel (as I may ſay) and not brought on ſo far as to become a real body, but only a vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Gas, which contains the beginnings and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Sulphur in it, and yet is not imbodyed in a Sulphur, but is as an Embryo before its imbodying in the Womb; from which, its name of an Embryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sulphur.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And that it is ſuch an embryonated Sulphur, which predominates in theſe Sulphureous Springs, appears by evaporating ſome of that water, and you ſhall find that before half of the moiſture be gone it hath loſt all its Sulphureous odour; becauſe ſo vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile as not the leaſt of it diſcernable in any body of Sulphur or otherwiſe: nay, though one ſhould diſtil it with never ſo much curioſity of exactly fitting and joynting Receivers, yet would nothing of a Sulphur become apparent, but would be gone inſenſibly; as happened to a ſolution of above a pound of thrice cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined Salt, which upon the affuſion of water did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly reſemble the Sulphur Well, as I ſaid, which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and placed over the fire to evaporate, before one half was gone it had loſt all its embryonative Sulphur, being ſo volatile as it took wings, by the aſſiſtance of ſo much heat, and left no footſteps of its preſence.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thirdly, I conclude that ſuch a ſolution of the <hi>Sal Marine,</hi> together with its embryonated Sulphur, in a <hi>ſabulous</hi> Spring (having received that previous digeſtion in the intrails of the Earth, as to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent its Embryo Sulphur) may be nearer the <hi>Primum Ens Salium,</hi> then a coagulated Salt; and may be better taken in order to the preparation of that great Solvent, the <hi>Sal circulatum.</hi> And my reaſon is partly grounded upon a ſentence of the grave and long experienced <hi>Helmont,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>In Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure ſunt fermenta, fracedines, odores, ſapores ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifici
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41152:83"/>ſeminum ad quaſvis tranſmutationes,</hi> that is, In Sulphur are ferments, hogo's, ſmells, ſpecifick taſts of ſeeds fit for all tranſmutations; ſo that in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of Sulphurs, lyeth the main wheel of all tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: the beginnings to which are alſo putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which thoſe Embryo-Sulphurs may much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. For all bodies that are capable of reſolution into Heterogeneities, their texture is ſubverted by the working of ferments upon the Sulphurs of ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whereby they may be readily analyz'd or taken in pieces.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Laſtly, That Spirits (ſuch I call the <hi>Primum Ens ſalium</hi>) before they are coagulated upon Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals or other bodies, are but in <hi>Embryo,</hi> or in their infancy (as I may call it) or nonage; and therefore coagulable upon bodies to the impairing of their own activity, by locking themſelves up in the textures of bodies: and ſo require a reſolution from their coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, before they can be brought to that purity and ſimplicity they were in, when they found bodies to dwell in, <hi>viz.</hi> before incorporation.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Hence it is that <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> giving an hint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preparation of his grand Liquor <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſt</hi> (which I do not remember he calls by that name in all his Writings, ſave <hi>De Viribus Membro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. Cap. De Hepate;</hi> but by <hi>Sal circulatum, Primum Ens ſalium, &amp;c.</hi>) ſaith, <hi>à coagulatione reſolvatur &amp; iterum coaguletur in formam tranſmutatam;</hi> that is (as I apprehend) That ſeeing we can ſcarcely find the <hi>Primum Ens ſalium</hi> in its pure ſpirituality, and naked ſimplicity, but as it is infolded in the arms of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral body, and ſo coagulated into many ſhapes of Salts, as Marine, Vitriol, Allom, Nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are ſeveral bodies, wherein this hidden Spirit or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal embryonative Solvent, appears to our view
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41152:84"/>in divers corporeal dreſſes, putting on (<hi>Proteus</hi> like) new ſhapes according to the Mineral veſtment, wherewith he is cloathed, requires therefore (if we would have him appear unmasked) to be reſolv'd from his coagulation; till then we cannot expect him capable of performing much in the way of a penetrating Maſter-Solvent, but acts according to the freedom of his keepers.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And though this Spirit or <hi>Primum Ens ſalium,</hi> while it is in its infancy or <hi>embryo,</hi> be ſo weak as to claſp hold of every body that comes near it, and proſtitute it ſelf to every woer, in many ſtrange Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral bodies; ſo as to dibilitate it ſelf before it arrive to thoſe more mature and maſculine functions of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating and diſſolving bodies, without being conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with their touches, or debilitated and baffled by their re-action: I ſay notwithſtanding this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit before coagulation; yet if after the the reſolution, it becomes ſet at liberty from its bonds, divorced from its firſt conſort, and then exalted and fortified in its own purity by a gradual proceſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo noble and virile a liquor, as that it acts upon all Mineral, Animal and Vegetable Concretes, diſſolving them into their <hi>Primum ens</hi> or ſeminal <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> whereby their medicinal virtues are at hand; and that without the leaſt re-actions of thoſe bodies upon this univerſal Solvent Liquor. But to return.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. This <hi>Spaw</hi> as to medicinal uſe is not of much more efficacy than ſo much Trencher-ſalt, diſſolved in ſuch a proportion of water, anſwerable to that of the Sulphur-Well, which both alike would much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what have the ſame operation; only the <hi>foetid</hi> embry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Sulphur doth ſomewhat provoke nature, and therefore extimulate the expulſive faculty of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, purging either upward or (which the rather) downward.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:41152:84"/>13. The plenty of the Salt wherewith it is ſtrongly ſaturate, preſerves much againſt Putrefaction and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes thence proceeding, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt worms, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick corrupt matter in the ſtomach and inteſtines, which ſo much common Salt as I ſaid diſſolv'd in fair water would effect the ſame. The blackiſh Salt which remains after the boyling up of the water, hath no more virtue againſt worms (for which it is frequently uſed) than a like quantity of common Salt; for it hath no ſpecifical difference from common Salt, eſpecially when depurated by ſolution, filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and evaporation: then it is exactly the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And though there be a <hi>Marcaſite</hi> or ſtone of Vitriol to be found about Sixſcore yards from this Well, which will fall in the Air in a moiſt place; and by ſolution, filtration, and evaporation, will become a tranſparent green Vitriol, as an ingenuous Friend of mine for tryal ſake made: I ſay though this be found near it, yet doth not in the leaſt partake thereof, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in taſte nor virtue.</p>

                  <head>Concerning the Original of Hot Springs.</head>
                  <p>IT is not the leaſt amongſt Chymical Enquiries, to know the true original cauſe of heat, whether in Vegetables, Animals or Minerals; amongſt which, the cauſe of hot Springs, is not inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, ſeeing that in them are found many medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable virtues, uſeful for the help of Man.</p>
                  <p>Where I ſhall proceed, firſt to ſhew, That hot Springs or Baths are from Mineral Salts; next, How Mineral Salts upon the contact of one another, or of Mineral bodies, are the efficient cauſes of heat in thoſe Springs; and thirdly, How artificial Baths may be made analogical in virtue and operation to the natural; and Laſtly ſhall ſhew the efficacy of hot Springs and Baths, whether natural or artificial.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, That hot Springs or Baths are from Mineral Salts, is evident, becauſe no Mineral or Metalline body, is diſſolvable or alterable in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth, without the concourſe of Salts; for in the Mineral and Metalline Kingdom there are but two Agents, which makes the great alterations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe bodies, and thoſe are Fire and Salts. by Fire, I mean not only the external and elementary fire, by whoſe force Metals and Minerals become ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from their connate Heterogeneities, and brought to the beſt; but alſo the inward inbred fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sulphur of thoſe bodies which ripens and maturates the Minerals and Metals, making them more or leſs pure, according to the diſpoſition of the place and graduation of the Sulphur.</p>
                  <p>By Salts I mean the <hi>Primum Ens ſalium,</hi> with its various coagulations into ſpecificated Salts; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe Agents, all Mineral and Metalline bodies are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41152:85"/>at reſt. There are neither ſolutions nor coagulations.</p>
                  <p>Now there are few ſorts of earth through which water in its current paſſeth (ſaving the <hi>Quellem</hi> or <hi>Arena bulliens</hi>) but they are impregnate with Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral juyces, of one ſort or other, which by ſome ſleight touch of a Mineral Salt in the water-Spring, becomes diſſolv'd in ſome ſmall proportion, enough to give that great difference we find in Spring-water, both as to taſte (which ſome that have accurate palates, and have accuſtomed themſelves to drink water, can eaſily diſcern an eminent difference, in taſte of one ſort of Spring-water from another) as alſo to the frequent uſe waters are put to, both for boyling meat, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bleaching cloaths, Dying, Tanning, Brewing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which difference I ſay proceed ſome ſmall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of different Mineral juyces, by the <hi>Medium</hi> of a little touch of Salt, diſſolv'd in the ſubterraneal chanels of water. Here I might expatiate and ſhew the reaſons of the difference of waters, both as to taſte, and alſo in order to the foreſaid uſes; but leaſt I make theſe papers ſwell too much I ſhall wave it.</p>
                  <p>My next work is to ſhew, How Mineral Salts upon the mutual contact of each other, or of Mineral bodies, are the efficient cauſe of heat in thoſe Springs I am now ſpeaking of. To which purpoſe, I ſhall propound ſeveral mechanical experiments of the productions of heat; as firſt from the mixing acid and alkalizate Liquors, as for inſtance of Oyl of Vitriol, with Oyl of Tartar, which upon mixing give a great heat, making a ſtrong ebullition, which when over, the heat waſteth; and that is either when the one by its greater proportion, over-acts or overcomes the other: or when both proportionable, they are reduc'd to an <hi>Equilibrium</hi> or neutral Salt, called <hi>Tartarum Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum.</hi> Which heat is caus'd not only by Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41152:86"/>upon the <hi>Alkali</hi> of Tartar; but alſo by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acid Spirit, as Spirit of Nitre, Spirit of Salt, <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> Spirit of Vinegar or the like, which after the ebullition is over, give a <hi>Tartarum nitroſum, ſalinum, acetoſum, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as Salts, mutually acting upon each other, cauſe heat; ſo in like manner do ſome Liquors or Spirits, affus'd upon Salts effect the ſame, as Spirit of Wine poured upon drie Salt of Tartar, will make a great heat, ſo that in mixing them, to rectifie Spirit of Wine therefrom, we uſually do it <hi>per vices</hi> or by ſprinkling the Salt leiſurely therein, leaſt we ſhould indanger the glaſs by heating it too much. The like heat happens by pouring the Spirit of Wine upon Arſenick fixt upon Nitre, which as from the ſame cauſe, with that of Spirit of Wine upon Salt of Tartar; for the Nitre by the open calcination with Arſenick, is partly turned into a fixed <hi>Alkali:</hi> which that it is ſo, appears, becauſe if to the dulcified Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenical powder (after the waſhing away the Salts) Spirit of Wine be poured, no heat is contracted. So water poured upon <hi>Calx vive,</hi> gives a conſiderable heat, which it doth by reſolving the acid and alkalizate Salts contained therein; who by their mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt cauſe an heat.</p>
                  <p>As Salts acting one upon another, and the affuſion of ſome Liquors alſo upon them, cauſe heat; ſo alſo Salts acting upon Minerals or Metalline bodies by corroſion and diſſolution, are the efficients of heat. Thus any corroſive <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> fretting Mineral, or Metalline bodies cauſe the ſame; as for inſtance, in the ſolution of any Metal in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> during the ebullition there is an heat: ſo in making the <hi>Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Martis,</hi> upon the affuſion of the <hi>Menſtrum,</hi> the heat is ſo very ſtrong, as that I have not been able to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41152:86"/>hold the glaſs in my hand. Which proceeds from the agile Spirits of Salts, fretting upon the Metalline com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, taking it in pieces, and reducing it <hi>in minima;</hi> in whoſe forcible (not natural) <hi>Analyſis,</hi> through the agility of motion the heat is cauſed.</p>
                  <p>But in the pouring <hi>Aqua Regia</hi> upon Antimony or Spirit of Nitre, upon <hi>Butyrum Antimonii</hi> for the making <hi>Bezoardicum Minerale,</hi> there an heat is cauſed by an actual humid calcination of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of that Mineral; where the Sulphur by thoſe corroſive Spirits, almoſt takes flame, paſſeth off with a ſtrong ſtifling Arſenical vapour.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the motion of bodies, one upon or againſt another, by concuſſion or frication, cauſe heat; ſo fermentation gives quickneſs of motion, and that produceth heat: which is ſenſibly perceived in ſome fermenting liquors, in others not.</p>
                  <p>Now the Query pertinent to my purpoſe is, Which of all theſe ſeveral cauſes of heats, may probably be the efficient of hot Springs? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That it is moſt likely to proceed from Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Salts, one acting upon another; that is, from the Eſſurine Salt (which alone with a ſlight touch of a Mineral, give being to thoſe <hi>Fontes Acidi, viz.</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioline <hi>Spaws</hi>) which meeting in the chanels of the Earth with ſome lixivial <hi>Marcaſites,</hi> are by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of a water-Spring diſſolv'd and ſet a boyling; one working and fretting upon another, give that heat to the water, which diſſolves them. Which two Salts, <hi>viz.</hi> Acid and Alkalizate, are ſometimes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryonative in the ſame <hi>Marcaſite,</hi> which may happen in ſome natural ſtone or middle Mineral of <hi>Calx Vive;</hi> into which a current of water being opened, preſently diſſolves the two Salts, makes them conteſt and ſtruggle, by reaſon of the antipathy of their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41152:87"/>natures; and thereby cauſe the heat in hot Baths.</p>
                  <p>So that in ſhort, It is very probable that it is from a natural ſtone of <hi>Calx Vive;</hi> which being plentiful in the <hi>Minera</hi> thereof, may give cauſe for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuation of heat. To confirm which, Some have found a white <hi>Marcaſite</hi> about the place of thoſe hot oprings in <hi>Sommerſet-ſhire,</hi> which put into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter give; an heat. Now that two ſuch oppoſite Salts ſhould be embryonate in the ſame Mineral ſtone, is an argument, that the ſeminal principles of Nature are at work in all places, according to the capacity and manner of the matters reception, <hi>viz. ad modum recipientis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calx Vive</hi> diſtill'd with freſh Urine, makes the Spirit thereof ariſe at the firſt, with that difference alſo from ſoliary Spirit of Urine, as that it gives cauſe to think, that ſome volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> of the <hi>Calx</hi> ariſeth up with it, which hinders the coagulation of the Spirit into an <hi>Offa</hi> with Spirit of Wine, uſually happening from ſimple Spirit of Urine, and Spirit of Wine mixed together. Which very thing argues the difference of Salts of <hi>Calx Vive;</hi> That it hath an <hi>Alkali</hi> in it, is demonſtrable enough from its inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of grounds; for which purpoſe it is frequently uſed in barren Soyls, which the Country-man chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for ſome grounds, rather than Manure. That there is an acid Salt therein, is ſomewhat diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the taſte.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort of heat I have obſerved to proceed from the contact of Salts, and the <hi>Calx</hi> of Metals; as for inſtance in the following experiment, I took of the <hi>Caput mort,</hi> of <hi>Viride Eris,</hi> from whence the <hi>Spiritus Veneris</hi> had been rectified, being a very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> with which I mixed an Anatical proportion of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> pulverized very well

                  <p>When I had well incorporated them together, for ſo they ſhould be; in as much as when any ſutable body or Spirit, is to penetrate and work an alteration in another body, they then do it beſt when they touch each other <hi>per minima:</hi> thence Contritions and Sublimations are the <hi>Piſtilla Chymica,</hi> by which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations are made of one body by another. I ſay, when I had well incorporated them, I put them into a paper, thinking the next day to have put them into a Retort; but within leſs than one quarter of an hour I perceived ſuch a ſtrong penetrating urinous ſmell, as made me admire whence it ſhould proceed, which put me in fear of ſome glaſs being broke in my <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum.</hi> At length I came near the paper, and preſently found it to be that which ſent forth ſuch a ſtrong o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; which when I took up off the Table, was ſo hot as I could ſcarce ſuffer to hold it. I made haſt to put it into a Retort, which before I could do, it well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh burnt my hand.</p>
                  <p>By this experiment thus far, Two things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable appeared; one, conducing to illuſtrate, as I ſaid, the nature of fluidity to conſiſt in minuteneſs of parts; the other is, That heat (and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the reſt of the qualities ſo call'd) are a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſpoſition and adaption of parts of bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves after ſuch and ſuch a manner, as to work differently upon one and the ſame body:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41152:88"/>ſo that a brisk motion of the conſtituent particles, either by an innate fermentation or extrinſick excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from another ſubtile body, is ſufficient to cauſe that we call heat.</p>
                  <p>Some other cauſes there are of hot Springs, <hi>viz.</hi> Subterraneal Fires, ſet on work by the flagration of <hi>Bitumen</hi> or Sulphur; which being kindled in ſome parts of the Earth, where being cloſe pent up, not finding vent, cauſeth Earthquakes: but when it breaks forth, it ſometimes forceth with that violence, as that if it break forth under the Sea, it throws up ſtones and earth in ſuch abundance, as that a new Iſland is thrown up of a ſuddain in the midſt of the Sea; and that for many Leagues together, the Sea is at that time covered over with the ſpongy Pumice-ſtone, which is the <hi>Caput mort</hi> in the flagration of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Other places there are by which, as Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys or Flewes, the Subterraneal Fire finds vent, as <hi>Aetna, Veſuvius, Strongilo, Vulcano, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Subterraneal Fires, the ingenuous <hi>Kircker</hi> in his <hi>Mundus Subterraneus</hi> calls <hi>Pyrophylacia,</hi> which being conveighed by ſeveral Subterraneal Pipes or Chanels to thoſe Ciſterns or receptacles of water called <hi>Hydrophylacia,</hi> which thereby become heated, and that in places not far from day, I mean the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Earth, breaks forth in hot Springs. Theſe <hi>Pyrophylacia</hi> it is very probable are the cauſe of ſome hot Springs, as the kindling of <hi>Calx Vive</hi> are of others. Of which laſt <hi>Fallopius</hi> tells us, <hi>In agro Volaterrano ad caſtellum montis Cerbari vocatum, ſunt lacus dicti vulgo, lagoni, quaſi lacunae, ubi eſt aqua ferventiſſima, &amp; undique cinis; quinimo &amp; mons qui ibidem eſt, totus calce &amp; cinere refertus eſt calido, adeo ut calceamenta exurat, uti ipſe ſum (inquit) aliquando expertus.</hi> Theſe <hi>Phyrophylacia</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:41152:88"/>heat the waters, ſometimes <hi>in ipſis cuniculis;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while they heat Mineral ſtones through which water paſſeth: either way make hot Springs.</p>
                  <p>Thus having numbred up the ſeveral ſorts of heats, and amongſt them pitched upon that which is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of hot Springs; amongſt which alſo (by the by) the preparation of the body of Steel is performed; whereby it will the moſt part of it readily diſſolve in any Vehicle, and make a Mineral water like <hi>Tunbridge, Epſom</hi> and <hi>Knarsborough Spaw,</hi> Let us now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how artificial Baths may be made; and thoſe are either ſuch as are more common, as the decoctions of Vegetables and Salts in water and other liquors, wherein Diſeaſed Perſons are frequently put, alſo to have the body (all but the head) inclos'd within the ſteams of hot water, or to ſit under a frame of Paſtboard with Spirit of Wine flaming in a large Lamp-veſſel, which is a kind of Stoving Bath or Stoves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or ſuch Baths as are more rare, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirit of Wine with Salt of Tartar, either for ſome particular parts of the body, or for the whole, if ſome Patients upon extraordinary occaſions would go to the charge thereof; alſo Sulphur ſo artificially contriv'd, as that the flame thereof ſhall heat a large veſſel of water, in imitation of the terreſtrial fires, wherewith ſome Baths or Springs are made hot: which Bath might conſtantly be kept hot by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſupply of freſh Sulphur, in manner of the Fountain which the <hi>Romans</hi> made conſtantly by art to flow hot; which was performed by ſome braſs Pipes wound up in Gyres, <hi>In ſpiras voluti inſtar Draconis,</hi> which were therefore called <hi>Dracones,</hi> under which they made a fire, by which the firſt Spires were made warm, the next more, the next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain yet hotter, ſo that the water did continually
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41152:89"/>flow forth hot. After which ſort with ſome little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, Phyſicians might keep hot baths with Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal waters, ſuted for the Patients Diſeaſe, conſtantly at work with a ſmall charge, after the veſſels were once artificially contriv'd. To which purpoſe I have had a <hi>Balneum Maria</hi> kept hot for digeſtions, by Leaden Pipes placed in Gyres in a wooden veſſel.</p>
                  <p>The advantage of ſuch artificial contriv'd Baths, is this, That the Phyſician may preſently change his medicated waters, as occaſion offers, can give what degree of warmth he pleaſeth, and keep them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in an equal heat, which cannot eaſily be performed by the common ſort of Baths; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore comes nearer in efficacy to the natural hot Springs than the other, and ſo conſequently more effectual.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the virtues of Baths natural or artificial, they are of large extent, and may be, if skillfully managed, of much uſe in helping many Diſeaſes, as the Palſie, Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which by opening the pores, and thereby removing the obſtructing or afflicting cauſes of the <hi>Genus Nervoſum,</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be ſucceſsful in all the Diſeaſes thereof; alſo the Hypochondriack Melancholy, by opening the external portals, alieviating of the Spirits, giving vent for the <hi>flatus,</hi> and with the help of inward ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rients; may dulcifie the blood and humours from their feculent tartneſs, whereby the cohobations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purations of the blood, upon its <hi>Caput mort</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of its <hi>feces</hi> in its paſſage through the Spleen, may ſucceed the better.</p>
                  <p>Alſo may be effectual in <hi>Atrophyes, Aridura,</hi> Witheredneſs of the parts, by helping a freſh fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the blood, which may force its paſſage into the otherwiſe deſerted parts; and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41152:89"/>capable of diſtributing an equal nouriſhment to all parts.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe Baths are of efficacy in all ſorts of Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pains, Numbneſs and Lameneſs of the Joynts, by opening the pores of the body, abſolving the Nerves from their obſtruents, dinting the acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſharpneſs of the <hi>Latex,</hi> giving current to the blood; and at length reducing the nervous and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous parts to their due and proper order and tone: Alſo in other Diſeaſes, as Rickets in Children, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Tumors, and Defedations of the skin in elder People; towards the effecting of which, no ſmall variety of the Chymical <hi>Apparatus</hi> or Mineral Drugs, are <hi>in promptu</hi> for that purpoſe.</p>

                  <head>A ſhort Vindication of Chymical Phyſick.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe ſtrange uncouthneſs of Chymical Phyſick, is ſuch; yea the very name of Chymiſtry hath been ſo much a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in theſe Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> that, what through the <hi>Odium</hi> caſt upon it by the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> on purpoſe to keep it under hatches; and what through the empty, fruitleſs, boaſting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders thereto, who not being Artiſts were its onely diſparagers: By both which it hath ſuffered ſeverely, in the ears of the generality of People, in ſo much that when they have heard of it, they have ſtood amaz'd. To venture the taking of any Medicine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable thereby, they durſt not. Why? What was the matter? They knew not, only they had heard ſtrange reports, which frighted them. Their Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians told them, <hi>They were hot things, ſuch as would burn their bowels; and therefore very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yea, till within this ten or a dozen years, this Noble Science hath undergone much ignominy, or elſe moſtwhat unknown in moſt parts of <hi>England;</hi> yes and in Forreign Parts too, unleſs here and there one, who if he practiced by it did it privately: ſo that he who hath bent his endevours that way, to find out more effectual Remedies by the <hi>Spagyrical</hi> Art, hath been lookt upon in theſe, as a Mathematician was in former days, who by the ignorant vulgar was eſteemed no better than a Conjurer; ſo that a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician and a Conjurer were accounted in the vulgar Idiom <hi>Synonima's,</hi> words of the ſame ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For if they dealt with Circles it was enough; they knew no difference between a Mathematical
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41152:90"/>Circle and demonſtrations drawn therefrom (which ſtill was as ſtrange to them) and a Conjuring Circle; like as a boy was once accuſed before a Magiſtrate for being a Fortune-Teller or Aſtrologer. It happened he had a little book in his pocket, wherein was ſome Schemes I ſuppoſe drawn by the help of <hi>Lillie</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction; which no ſooner did the Juſtice eſpy, but crys out, <hi>Circles, Circles, Sirrah theſe are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous things, we'll take a courſe with you:</hi> and ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the boy to be carryed away. By which you may ſurely conclude, that himſelf was no Conjurer, for he lov'd no Circles. Thus poor Circles and Chymiſtry hath been deeply accus'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not long ſince the genius of ſome preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wits began to ſet to work to underſtand and rightly prepare Chymical Remedies; firſt, Duely conſidering the nature of Ferments; and next, To ſearch after the various Solvents, and their manner of operation, without which nothing very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is preparable in Chymical Phyſick: ſo that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good improvement of late hath been made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, witneſs the elaborate Pieces of ſome ingenuous Perſons.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſhall therefore, firſt, ſay what the <hi>Spagyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Art or Chymical Science is; next, endevour to take off the reproach or calumny laid thereon, by anſwering the objections againſt it; and laſtly, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the great help nature hath thereby, above ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Shop-preparations, in order to the Cure of Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Firſt, as to what it is. It is, in ſhort, ſuch a due Preparation of all Medicinal Concretes, whether Animal, Vegetable or Mineral, as the pure balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick lively parts becomes ſeparated from the impure feculencies; for we ſee that in all Concretes there
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41152:91"/>is a mixture of pure and impure, of groſs and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious parts; ſome feculent and dreggy; others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd and depurated, though indeed the mixture of theſe together makes up a complete body, which hath its uſe and place in the creation: yet, as to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable uſe, it's the pure, nimble, ſpiritous parts of Vegetables or Animals; or the depurated fixt parts; or laſtly, the reunion of both after purification, which effects the work, in aſſiſting nature againſt the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Which Preparations are performed two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> either by digeſtion, or by diſtillation; under that of digeſtion is comprehended fermentation, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, extraction and putrefaction, and that by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile Solvents, connatural with or emergent from the bodies of the Concretes themſelves, or by additional <hi>Menſtruums:</hi> all which doth macerate, ferment and diſſolve the texture of the body, and fits it for ſeparation by diſtillation. The additional <hi>Menſtruums</hi> for extractions, are either vinous, oleaginous, uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous or acetous Spirits; or a product from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures: all which do prepare towards the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Concrete.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. All Vegetables or Animals, or at leaſt the moſt, by bare diſtillation yield a Phlegm, a volatile Salt, an Oyl, and in the <hi>Caput mort</hi> a fit Salt, ſeparable from the remaining uſeleſs <hi>Faeces;</hi> but by a previous fermentation; if the juyces of Vegetables, they firſt yield a vinous Spirit, then a Phlegm, leaving their Tartar behind, out of which by diſtillation with a ſtronger fire, is got a Phlegm, an acid Spirit, an Oyl, out of whoſe <hi>Faeces</hi> again is a fixt Salt, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but if the Vegetable undergo a more natural ſpontaneous fermentation, then that, which otherwiſe is an Oyl, ſeparates it ſelf by diſtillation, moſtwhat
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41152:91"/>in a volatile Spirit, or volatile Salt. All ſorts of Wood or Plants, by naked force of fire are diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into an acid Spirit, Phlegm, Oyl and Salt; as we ſee in burning of Wood, by the bare fire, the Chimneys become the Receivers to which the Soot cleaves: and that again diſtill'd, yields a Phlegm, an Oyl, and a volatile Salt, which laſt, by rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation becomes pure and of a lovely white colour. A very penetrative Medicine, uſeful in Diſeaſes of the <hi>Genus nervoſum;</hi> alſo a great preſervative againſt Putrefaction and Feavers thence enſuing. But I dare not proſecute particulars, leaſt I ſwell the volume too much.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But in general all Vegetable ſeparations of the pure from the impure, are made, as I ſaid, by digeſtions and diſtillations, the two main hinges of Chymical Preparations, by which their Spirits and Eſſences become ſeparated, which united with the extracted fixed Salt out of the <hi>Caput mort</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther digeſted together, eſpecially if the fixt Salt be made ſo as to diſſolve in moſt rectified Spirit of Wine, give moſt noble abſterſive and diuretick Salts, Whoſe virtues, in my Practice, I have much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Not that I deny the great bleſſing of the Moſt High, in thoſe ſpecifical endowments he hath pleaſed to inrich ſome Vegetables and other Concretes withal; who perform their work to which by a Divine Hand they are deſtin'd, and that without any Chymical Preparation: And yet ſome Specificks are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without ſome previous Preparations. An error in the due obſervation of which, many times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents or intercepts the full efficacy of the Remedy.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. There are it may be about a Score of choice Plants, which well managed with a skillful hand at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41152:92"/>due ſeaſons, may by their ſingular virtues, produce conſiderable effects; the reſt are not (that we know) of much uſe, ſaving for ornament, pleaſant ſmells, and food to Cattle. What heaps of Plants by ſome Phyſicians are ordered to ſtuff Diet-bags withal? whereas a few choice good ones might probably be more effectual. Some Phyſicians being call'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult about a Patient, who ordering a Diet-bag for him, having put in a ſufficient number of Plants, yet ſome of them would have heap'd in more; one wiſer than the reſt, very merrily bid them put in a Hay-cock, and then to be ſure they would have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. And indeed it would have proved a very good Magiſtery for an Horſe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. As for Animals, or the parts of Animals, preparable by the Chymical Art for the uſe of Man, are chiefly the Blood and Urine; the firſt of which, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood, is as an <hi>Elixir</hi> of all the parts of the body, where if any Spirits, Life or Vigour be, it's there; the other, <hi>viz</hi> the Urine, is a <hi>Latex</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colated through the Reins from the Blood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it ſelf much of the very ſame principles the Blood hath in it: ſo that both unfermented without any previous preparation, only by bare diſtillation yields firſt a Phlegm, and that in a great quantity, then a volatile Spirit and Oyl, and volatile Salt; and in the <hi>Caput mort</hi> of both, is ſome fixt Salt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembling Sea-Salt, if not really the ſame, ſeparable by ſolution from the remaining <hi>ſordes.</hi> But if both undergoe a previous fermentation, then the volatile Spirits becomes looſened from their bonds, and works themſelves at liberty; and that whether in cloſe or open veſſels: So that then diſtilled, yield at the very firſt, with a gentle fire, their volatile Spirits, and the Phlegm after.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:41152:92"/>12. So that fermentation inverts the order of the parts, coming off by diſtillation; and that whether in vinous or urinous liquors (by urinous, I alſo include the blood) For take the juyce of the Grape, or of any vegetable fruit, whether Apples, Pears, Cherries, or the like, diſtill them, and you ſhall at the firſt have nothing but a great quantity of phlegm, and at laſt a ſmall portion of the true genuine Spirit, together with a fetid Oyl: even as is got (though with ſome difference of Spirit) from blood and urine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled crudely.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But if you ferment the juyce of Grapes, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Pears, Cherries, or the like, then is the vinous Spirit ſet at liberty from the bonds of the compage of the body, and in diſtillation with a gentle heat, comes up firſt, and the phlegm after; and that which was an Oyl before, is, partly by the volatizing ferment tranſmuted into Spirit; and partly by refining in the veſſels, after fermentation, is ſetled to the ſides thereof in form of Tartar, which diſtill'd with a ſtronger fire, gives, amongſt other diſtillables, that fetid empyreu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Oyl which we ſee it yields in plenty.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. So that I ſay, Fermentation makes no ſmall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, whether in vegetable, or animal juyces, by ſetting the true genuine Spirit, whether vinous or uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, at liberty, from the fetters of the body thereof; which juyces, if neither diſtill'd, nor fermented, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into acid, ſowre, vinegariſh Liquors, which if not kept from the Air by cloſe ſtopt veſſels, will very ſhortly contract a mouldineſs, and decay into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid uſeleſs Liquors: even ſo alſo the blood in its own veſſels, if not volatized from its connatural ferment, becomes ſowriſh, degenerates into a vinegar, or rather blood in Chronical diſeaſes, and by a further impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhment of Spirits, becomes at length vapid, whence death.</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:41152:93"/>15. And as blood and urine are Animal parts, which receive alſo a ſeparation of their heterogeneous parts by diſtillation; and that differently, by being fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, or not: ſo alſo Harts-horn may well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted another, whoſe parts are ſeparable by the Chymical Art, and if well prepared, are of much ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy. I ſpeak the rather of the Horns of that Creature, becauſe no other that I know of, renews his Horns yearly, as the Stag doth; which being vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as well as animal (I mean the Horns) gives no ſmall hopes of (yea, we know gives) a good Medicine.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. This Creature, when freſh Graſs cometh in the Spring, begins to have an effloreſcence in his blood, which becomes turgent with volatile active ſpirits; and having more then can well be diſpenced with in the veſſels, begins from a natural inſtinct peculiar to that Creature to attempt a new production, by laying a foundation of new Horns: which increaſing by the yet more turgidneſs of the blood with thoſe volatile Spirits, i'th' concluſion part of which volatile Spirits, together with ſome ſucculent parts of the blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come animated into little vermicles, by an incipient putrefaction, which begets a pruriency or Itching in the blood, and that makes the Stag run his Horns againſt every thing in his way, and never quiet till he hath knock't the old Horns off.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And that is the reaſon Harts-horn, above all other Horns, is ſo replete with volatile Spirits; which how to ſeparate, requires the help of the Chymical Art. Its not by reducing it into Gelly, by boyling it in water, that's not enough; for in Gellies of Harts-horn, ſuch as is made uſually for weak perſons in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Conſumptions, or other lingring Diſtempers, the volatile Spirit wherein the real efficacy conſiſts, is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41152:93"/>not at all ſet at liberty: but ſo cloſely hedg'd in with other parts in the compage, that Nature can find ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little benefit therefrom. So that as a Gelly I look upon it as no better, than any other Gelly from knu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckles of Veal or the like; for all fleſh and horns by boyling in water are reducible into Broth: and that by further boyling into Gelly. Which is indeed a good Kitchin-Preparation of meat for weak ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs: but as to matter of Medicine yields very ſmall or none.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. So that if we would ſhare with its virtue, which lodgeth in its volatile Spirit or Salt, we muſt diſtill it, which may be well done in a glaſs Retort; and by degrees of fire, it yields firſt a Phlegm; then by a ſtronger fire, a Spirit; and at laſt an Oyl, and volatile Salt. Theſe ſeparated and purified by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterate rectification, gives the pure, nimble, vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirit or Salt of Harts-horn, very proper in Fevers, both to help the ferment of the ſtomach, as alſo to abſterſe the ſanguineous veſſels, and to carry off a ſpurious tainted <hi>Latex,</hi> from the blood by tranſpiration; alſo proper for Colical-gripings and other pains from ſharp fretting humors in other parts of the body: only it is not very palatable, which makes ſome diſguſt it, before they receive the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected benefit by it.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But how to make this volatile Spirit or Eſſence of Harts-horn come over the helm before the Phlegm; and that with a gentle heat, whereby it may be capable of inſinuating the better, and more naturally into our digeſtions, that is, I ſay, the difficulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it wants ſuch a copious moiſture as Blood and Urine hath, by which they eaſily ferment, and give their Spirit firſt: but this is an hard drye ſolid body, and expoſed never ſo long to the Air will nor reſolve or ferment.</p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:41152:94"/>20. To which purpoſe there is a way, which now occurs to my mind, though I muſt confeſs I never tryed it, becauſe it is the firſt time I thought of it, which though conjectural yet very probable; and it is thus. Take the ſimple Gelly of Harts-horn, put a competent quantity thereof in a <hi>Matraſs,</hi> lute it exactly, ſet it in the heat of Horſe dung or <hi>Balneo</hi> to putrefie, for Twenty or Thirty days; then put it a Retort or glaſs-body and head, diſtill: which very probably will yield its pure volatile eſſence with a gentle heat before the Phlegm, becauſe its volatile parts by fermentation will become extricated from the other more ſluggiſh conſtitutive parts.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. As in Vegetables and Animals, ſo likewiſe in Minerals, the Chymical Art is no leſs requiſite; for all Mineral Salts, middle Minerals or <hi>Marcaſites,</hi> and Metals, are all either ſo crude, lockt up, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poyſonous, as that without the help of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotecknical</hi> Art in opening, maturating, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting by the fire, they deny us that innate hidden virtue, granted to them by God for the help of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Mineral Salts unleſs they be diſtill'd or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim'd (with other additionals) they communicate little of their operative virtue to us; whereas by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, putrefaction or diſtillation, they prove noble Solvents for Mineral and Metalline Solutions. Middle Minerals, as Antimony, the <hi>Marcaſite</hi> or Mineral ſtone of Vitriol, <hi>Biſmuth, &amp;c.</hi> have ſuch venomous properties, that unleſs corrected by the power of fire and good Solvents, they do not only deny us the noble medicinal virtue;, thoſe native endowments, but actually impreſs their virulency, upon our vital principles.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Whereas if rightly prepared by the fire and proper Solvents, correcting their virulency by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41152:94"/>and ſeparating their malignant, Arſenical, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible Sulphurs, and thereby ſetting at liberty their genuine inbred medicinable <hi>Arcana's,</hi> becomes noble Medicines for all curable Diſeaſes. All which is done by fire, or by that which is equivalent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (nay ſometimes more powerful than fire) <hi>viz.</hi> Solvents; which if rightly made, are only liquid fires, or <hi>Ignis Aqua;</hi> by which Mineral bodies are calcin'd <hi>in humido,</hi> as by an actual fire <hi>in ſicco.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. Alſo all Metals if not wrought upon by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Solvents, are lockt up, as to communicating their virtues, and therefore need particular Solvents to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their bodies; which if rightly done muſt be brought into an Oyl, of the colour of the Sulphur of the Metal, which are the <hi>Hematina Metallorum Paracelſi,</hi> irreducible to their <hi>priſtine</hi> Metalline form, Whence the true <hi>Aurum &amp; Argentum potabile, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. Thus you ſee in ſhort, How neceſſary, the Chymical Art is, to the unfolding of the various Concretes, whether Vegetables, Animals, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals: How by that noble ſeparating Art, we learn to take things in pieces, to reſolve them by a genuine natural <hi>Analyſis</hi> into their native principles, to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſuperfluities, to reunite the volatile parts with the fixt, and thereby produce generous eſſences; and all this without any great force of fire, except in thoſe bodies whoſe compage is more firm, and bends not to gentle ways of reſolution. Such bodies we examine with a ſtronger fire, till they yield and at length confeſs their natures.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Now I ſhall anſwer what the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> are ready to object againſt this Art. Firſt, they ſay Chymical Remedies are dangerous becauſe they are hot. Where in the firſt place, they do <hi>petere princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,</hi> ſuppoſing all ſuch preparable Remedies to be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41152:95"/>hot; which yet we deny, according to the vulgar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of heat, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as is actually ſo to the palate, witneſs <hi>Antimonium Diaphor. Bezoardicum Minerale, Cinnabar</hi> of Antimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None of which are actually hot to the taſte.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. But we will ſuppoſe with them, that they are actually hot in taſte and operation; and let us ſee what inconvenience will thence follow. Firſt, we find it certainly true, that cold is the greateſt enemy to life, and to vital heat the product of life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore above all things care is taken againſt unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cold. Why do we wrap our bodies and make our houſes as warm as we can againſt the injury of the cold? Why have we our meat every day, yea in Summer (excepting thoſe who are not able to go to the charge) provided warm for our ſtomachs? Why do we take our broths as hot as we can ſup them? Is it not to help the foſtering and cheriſhing our vital heat, and to preſerve the digeſtions intire againſt the grand enemy of nature, cold? Which is not a meer negative and privative quality of heat, but is a real poſitive <hi>Ens</hi> or actual being; and therefore abhorr'd of nature, which ſhe ſhuns and flies as the Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Death.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. You will ſay then, If cold be ſo great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy and ſo dangerous to the vital heat, How comes Feveriſh Perſons ſo much to deſire cold things, <hi>viz.</hi> cold drinks, or any cold thing to hold in their hand, or cold part of the bed to reach their feet to? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That they only deſire cold things through a depravation of their ſenſes and appetite, which now not being competent judges, requires things at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It's a meer juggle upon the ſenſes and appetite, being impos'd upon by the irregularities of the Fever; for firſt the <hi>aduſt Alkalizate</hi> recrement re-united in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41152:95"/>the tunicles of the Stomach of a Feveriſh Perſon, begets that unquenchable thirſt, and unſatisfied de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after cold drink: which thirſt that it is erroneous and deceitful appears, becauſe if great quantity of cold drinks be poured down, yet the thirſt remains; whence, through the depravation of the ferment, the appetite alſo becomes depraved. The ground of the deceitfulneſs of the ſenſe of Feeling, I preſume, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſome <hi>ſordes,</hi> which alſo are impacted upon the ſides of the veſſels of the blood, together with ſome Heterogeneities in the maſs of blood, which Nature endevouring to abſterſe and ſeparate, rowſeth up a ſtrong fermentation in the veſſels of the blood; and the more the recremental Tartar, is faſtened to the ſides of the tunicles of thoſe veſſels; and the more the Heterogeneities are, the ſtronger is the <hi>Niſus,</hi> or endevour to ſeparate them; and conſequently the greater is the ſenſible heat, which thereby perverting the ſenſe, makes it irregular in its preſſing after cold things.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. That the coveting of cold drink and cold things in Fevers, is (as I ſaid) a deception of the ſenſe, and a depravation of the appetite, further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; becauſe notwithſtanding the inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of cold things, yet if by any cold drink taken into the ſtomach, or by any accidental uncovering of the body, the <hi>Archeus</hi> or Regent Spirit of any part, becomes offended at its antagoniſt, the cold, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or other Diſtemper doth certainly encreaſe, the ſpurious fermentation of the blood becomes ſtronger, and conſequently the Feveriſh heat (which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant product thereof) is more violent, and all ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes grow worſe: And all this becauſe cold (the great enemy of vital heat) makes its onſet upon the vital principles unawares, through ſome incautious
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41152:96"/>accident, or deſignedly, through the depravedneſs of the appetite, which is bent to require that which is harmful to it, yea of which even in the very taking, it becomes convinc'd of its folly, by finding it doth not anſwer its expectation, <hi>viz.</hi> the quenchiing its thirſt.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. That cold is a real poſitive quiddity, ſomething really exiſtent in nature, and not a meer negative of heat (as ſome would ſuppoſe) which, if ſo, would in effect be nothing: but vital heat and mortal cold, ſtand both poſitives, counter, one oppoſing another, is, I ſay, demonſtrable by matter of fact. In cold Countries, in <hi>New England, Freezeland, Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ruſſia,</hi> where in the Winter time, the cold is actually ſo intenſe, as that if they do not by ſome artifice defend themſelves from the rigour thereof, it will freeze off their very Noſes; yea their fingers will become mortified, if they are too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the injury of the cold. But we need not go ſo far; for we ſee in our own Country in the Winter time in ſtrong Froſts that ſome parts become morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for inſtance, About three Years ago, a man was drunk at a Country Town, and in returning home his partner left him upon a Bridge, where expos'd to the cold froſt upon the hard ſtones, he had his lodging that night; the next morning he was found alive, but his hands and feet (the moſt remote parts from the fort of vital heat, the heart) were abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mortified, grew black as Pitch, and never redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to life or vital heat again, and therefore were cut off. It's very probable if the man had not been drunk, the cold would abſolutely have kill'd him; but the Spirits of the Liquor fortified the vital Spirits againſt the total ſubverſion thereof by cold.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And not only upon Animals but alſo upon
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41152:96"/>Vegetables Cold exerciſeth its tyranny. How are tender Plants in the Spring nipt with cold froſt? How do they flag and as it were hang the wing after a ſharp cold morning? Nay, How actually are the bloſſoms of fruit-Trees mortified and kill'd by froſts, the graſs nipt and kept back from growing? And all this by the mortal enemy Cold. That it is not a meer privation of heat, appears further, becauſe though the Sun be got into <hi>Taurus</hi> or <hi>Gemini,</hi> and thereby is in great force and very vigorous; yet we ſee that froſts come in <hi>May,</hi> and prove then mortal to many tender Plants: yea, as intenſe Cold will often happen in the latter end of <hi>May</hi> when the Sun is approching to the Tropick of <hi>Cancer;</hi> as when he is depreſs'd as far below in the Tropick of <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,</hi> yea, and more too, it is ſometimes warmer weather in <hi>December,</hi> than in ſome parts of <hi>May:</hi> So that the height and nearneſs of Sun, is not always the cauſe of heat; nor the lowneſs or remoteneſs thereof, of cold.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And though ſome ſuppoſe the cauſe of Cold and froſts in the Spring, to happen from the approch of the Sun into the Northern Signes, whereby the frozen Seas near the Pole become melted, and the cold being driven away by thoſe winds which comes over us, give us the cold and froſty air at that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Year; which ſuppoſe it were ſo: yet would it nothing infringe our doctrine of the poſitive eſſence of cold, but rather confirm it; yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagin that to be the cauſe of intenſe cold froſts in the Spring; and becauſe, if it were ſo, then when the Sun came to ſuch a point, as that its heat begun to reſolve thoſe frozen Northern Seas; as the heat, I ſay, of the Sun would be continually reſolving thoſe frozen Seas: ſo anſwerably the cold froſts
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41152:97"/>which ſhould thereby annoy us, would prove as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, which we ſee to the contrary; for in <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> the froſts and cold weather are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncertain, ſome days and nights together very warm, others again as cold, then warm again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">32 I rather think that Winds, Heat and Cold, Rain, Snow and Drought, are the Treaſures of God in the deep; and that they are committed to tutela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry influences of the Stars, which have keys to let them out upon the face of the Earth, at their due ſeaſons appointed by God; and that by thoſe <hi>Pero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledi</hi> and ſecret ſluces or chanels in the Air, over which the Stars are placed as Vicegerents, which whether they receive their influences immediately from God, or from ſome intermediate intelligences, or Angelical Powers, which are deeper than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: yet certainly this Divine Chain of coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and ſubordinate cauſe, reacheth from the Earth (as the Poets feign'd) to <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Chair, I mean from the ultimate product, to the primitive original cauſe, God himſelf. Although indeed its far otherwiſe, as to difference of weather in Iſlands, than upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; for upon the main Continent, the temperature of the Air is much at a certainty, according to the points of the <hi>Aphaelion</hi> or <hi>Perichaelion,</hi> remoteneſs or neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof to the Sun: and that according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral poſitions thereof in different Climates, which as the reverberation of the beam; of the Sun is more or leſs in the loweſt part of the Atmoſphere, or along the ſurface of the Earth; ſo is the heat or tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the Air anſwerable in thoſe places. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in Iſlands it's far different; for thoſe being envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with Seas on all hands, and it may be ſome of them old thrown up, as an Abortive Birth, out of the Womb of the Earth, by the great <hi>Demogorgon</hi> or
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41152:97"/>Subterraneal <hi>Vulcan;</hi> witneſs the Iſlands of <hi>Strongi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, Vulcano, &amp;c.</hi> As well as others have been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the vaſt Caverns thereof, and drowned in the Seas; witneſs the <hi>Terra Atlantica</hi> which was reputed bigger than <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> was ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, as the ingenuous <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cker</hi> relates out of <hi>Plato:</hi> Of which great Iſland thoſe called the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands and others in the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick</hi> Ocean are ſuppos'd to be the higheſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore left after that Deluge. I ſay ſeeing many (and for ought we know, moſt of the Iſlands have been belcht forth of the belly of the Earth, and alſo are incompaſſed with the waters, are therefore more inclinable to Subterraneal Belchings, Ructures, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, Exhalations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in ſome Iſlands not finding vent, is the cauſe of frequent Earthquakes; in others finding Flewes or Chimnies belch forth fire, ſmoak, ſtones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the third ſort of Iſlands, where there is neither thoſe actual Vent-holes (nor indeed is in need of them) nor is the Vapours ſo pent up as to force the Earth to a tremulation, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſages or pores large enough, breaks forth, and being carryed according to the <hi>Lation</hi> of the Air, is the probable cauſe of thoſe Storms, Winds, Hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes, and other alterations of weather within the Orb of the Atmoſphere, to which Iſlands and the adjacent Seas are more expos'd than the large Continent.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Cold, we ſee in Animals, is that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbs the Joynts, ſtupifies the parts, forceth the vital heat to retreat into its inward and more ſtrong forts; which if aſſaulted there, and overcome, death's at hand, and the combat over. Now if Cold be ſo great an enemy to vital heat, as is evident, not only from what I have ſaid, but from what every doth or may experiment, than no Medicine as a Medicine is or ought to be cold in its operation.</p>
                  <p n="34">
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:41152:98"/>34. And therefore to talk of Curing a Fever with cooling Medicines (as the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> frequently ſpeak) is very improper (not to ſay abſurd) and argues no leſs than ignorance of the eſſential cauſe of a Fever; which becauſe there is a great heat, ariſing from the boyling and ſpurious fermenting of the Spirits, therefore they think (according to their own maxim, <hi>Contraria contrariis curantur</hi>) that it muſt ſurely be Cured by cold things; and to that purpoſe, they follow a method of cooling to a purpoſe, both by frequent Phlebotomy, robbing the blood of its vital treaſure, whereby Cold (the great enemy of life) may indeed have better acceſs to the vitals and deſtroy the ſooner, as alſo by cooling Julips and cooling gliſters. Why do not they give them cold water in Gliſters, or blow a little cold wind into their breech? ſurely that would cool notably, and do the work more ſpeedily.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. It is very ſtrange to me, that their own day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſervation, doth not convince of the folly of adminiſtring cooling things; They cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that no good effect follows thereon. It is much to me they ſhould notwithſtanding the fruitleſsneſs of ſuch a method, yet again and again trace the ſame trod; unleſs they be reſolved never to go out of their pace (<hi>Spaniard</hi> like) though they be laſhed for it, both in their Reputation and otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Next to which they cannot but obſerve (which alſo moſt old wives take notice of) that the beſt and moſt hopeful Medicines in Fevers, are ſuch as cauſe ſweat; and therefore ordinary people will frequently, without the advice of a Phyſician, give Feveriſh Perſons ſomething to endevour ſweating: and that often times with very good ſucceſs. Which is a very fair admonition to Phyſicians to be more
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41152:98"/>ſerious and copious in Diaphoreticks; for therein indeed lyes the main hinge of Curing all ſorts of Fevers, which very thing is the leaſt conſulted of any other. They will Blood twice or thrice, and Purge as often; and yet ſcarce will they order one good Diaphoretick: which if they do, is commonly compounded with ſuch a farraginous mixture, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhors, and as ſoon ſweats to ſee the folly of the mixture, as naturally inclin'd thereto, by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Now no Diaphoretick was ever cold in its operation, but always of an heating attenuating property; and therefore of power to promote, the natural fermentation of the blood, and of abſterſing the veſſels of their recrements, and of carrying away by tranſpiration, the ſuperfluous tainted <hi>Latex</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other Heterogeneities (before diſturbing the oeconomy of the blood) and that through the pores of the body, though not always actually by ſweat, but ſometimes by inſenſible tranſpiration; for there is no better way of taking away the cauſe of exceſſive heat in Fevers, than by removing or allaying the baſtard fermentation in the blood, which is moſt aptly done by Diaphoreticks, eſpecially after a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious abſterſion of the primary digeſtions, by ſome generous Salts, or well prepared Solutives, together with an anodyne as an additional auxiliary.</p>
                  <p n="38">38 This and no way elſe according to the tenure of Nature, is (if we muſt ſpeak in the vulgar Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om) to cool the immoderate heat in Fevers, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to our own language, to reduce the blood and humors from their ſpurious and Feveriſh, into their own natural, genuine, fermentation, where the erratrick excentrick motions, becomes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and every thing falls into its natural courſe again.</p>
                  <p n="39">
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:41152:99"/>39. So that by this time I hope any ingenuous Perſon, will apprehend it to be diſſonant to the rules of Nature, and contrary to reaſon to adminiſter cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things in order to the Cure of a Fever; and further that hot things (ſuch I mean as are actually Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, with their previous preparatory abſterſive Salts) are the chief if not the only means to Cure burning Fevers, whether intermittent or continual; and conſequently, that the <hi>Galenical</hi> notion and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of cooling things, is very flat and frigid.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. They altogether prohibite the uſe of Wine in Fevers, as being (they ſay) too hot; miſtaking ſtill upon the old <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that heat is the efficient eſſential cauſe of a Fever, and therefore muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, by the actual preſence of a proportionate cold: whereas ſometimes I indulge the Feveriſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient with a glaſs of the richeſt Sack he can procure, eſpecially after the uſe of ſome noble abſterſive Salt, or as a Vehicle to give my Medicine in: and that too, becauſe I am ſatisfied, that heat is not the efficient cauſe of a Fever, but only a ſupervening ſymptome, conſequent to the Feveriſh fermentation.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. To confirm the truth of what I have ſaid, in order to the application of hot things in Fevers, or acute diſtempers of Colicks, or the like, I have had an experimental obſervation upon my ſelf, in a Colical Diſtemper, together with a Feveriſhneſs that accompanyed it, which ſurpriz'd me ſince the writing of the laſt Section or numerical diviſion; which, whether it proceeded from cold, or the tranſmiſſion of an acid juyce into the inteſtines, or from both, as the occaſional cauſe thereof, or from what other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring cauſe, I know not: but however this I am ſure of, and felt to my own great trouble, the <hi>tormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> Pains, or Gripings of the Colick; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41152:99"/>from a fermental acidity, rouzed up an acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious <hi>flatus,</hi> that not finding paſſage <hi>per inferiera</hi> (that vent-hole of inteſtine <hi>flatus</hi> or wind) returned upwards, oppreſs'd the ſtomach and vital Spirits; thence I became very ſick, and was ſomewhat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to vomit.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Whereupon, in order to my aſſiſtance, I took a Doſe of a gentle Emetick; but that nor reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Minera Morbi</hi> in the Inteſtines, I had little eaſe thereby, but rather grew worſe. Wherefore I ordered my Man to reach me a Doſe of an abſterſive Diuretick Salt; which, within two or three hours, wrought pretty plentifully by Urine, which gave me ſome eaſe: after which it began to incline me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words a breathing ſweat, and that I promoted by the advice of an ingenuous Friend, who came to viſit me, with a Doſe of the <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> a Medicine, than which (to taſte) nothing is more actually hot; which if ordered to another (who uſeth rather to conſult his palace than his health) he would have thought it, rather to encreaſe his heat, and to burn his bowels (as that whereof ſome of the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> accuſe that Medicine) than otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. But the ſucceſs thereof was very conſiderable, for I had not taken it paſt half an hour, but my ſweat was very much increaſed, my pains and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings abated, and my thirſt but ſmall; after which I ſweat very plentifully four or five hours, during which time, I took nothing but hot burnt Wine. Enough, a <hi>Galeniſt</hi> would have ſaid (who maketh heat to be the eſſential cauſe of a Fever) to have procur'd a Fever, though I found the contrary effect; and have not only taken it my ſelf, but have ordered the ſame: yea ſometimes accompanyed with volatile Spirits, as of Harts-horn or the like; and that with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41152:100"/>good ſucceſs in Fevers, it allying the thirſt (which nothing doth better than Diaphoreticks) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging the violence of pains, and abating moſt troubleſom ſymptomes, which accompany Fevers.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Not that I am ſtrictly confin'd to this Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but I the rather mention it, becauſe it is one of thoſe which the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> ſeverely forbid their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; and all their reaſon is, becauſe it is hot: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we have already ſhewed it to be not only ſafe, but alſo very neceſſary (I mean) that Diaphoreticks, whether they be hot in the taking, or actually ſuch in their operation, are moſt likely to Gure Fevers, and other acute Diſtempers; and that both by diſcuſſing the inbred <hi>flatus,</hi> as alſo by moving towards a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Heterogeneities in the maſs of blood, both which are moſt pertinent to be done in Fevers.</p>

                  <p>And as we can do nothing without fire, even in our common Coockery of meats and drinks; ſo can we do even as little without it, in the preparation of Medicines: which if they be of Vegetables, they are moſt what as crude, even as thoſe Vegetables we eat, as in Sallads; which what riftings and belchings they cauſe, eſpecially to weak ſtomachs, ſuch as eat them can beſt bear witneſs.</p>
                  <p>Beſides which crudities, there doth alſo an acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious virulency adhere to many Vegetables, as well as Animals or Minerals, which are no way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tam'd than by fire or ferments; for if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the leaſt footſteps, of virulency, whereby they become actually hoſtile to the vital oeconomy, they then muſt undergo a correction by the fire, or by ferments (which are equivalent to fire) before they can be made to fit to yield any Medicinal virtue, lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king under the mask of that virulency.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the <hi>Adepti</hi> corrects all poyſonous Plants, Animals or Minerals, by that fiery Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, <hi>The Alkaheſt;</hi> by which thoſe mixts forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with loſe their venomous properties, and become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in their genuine (though before <hi>dormant</hi>) fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutiferous endowments: whoſe poyſonous proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (I mean of Vegetables) may not a little alſo be corrected by bare digeſtions, or the addition of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous <hi>Menſtruums;</hi> as that of fixt Nitre, or ſtrongly calcin'd Salt of Tartar diſſolv'd <hi>per de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquium,</hi> Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Tartar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which often invert the properties of venemous Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables or Animals.</p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:41152:101"/>
                  <p>All which, together with diſtilled Vinegar, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute not a little towards the caſtigating the Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical malignity of Minerals. The latter, <hi>viz.</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Vinegar, is very requiſite for the extractions of the Sulphurs, Tinctures, or Souls (as <hi>Baſil Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> calls them) of the Metals or Minerals after their reduction into a ſpongy <hi>Calx;</hi> which alſo doth not a little correct Antimony, whether in glaſs or flowers: yea if poured upon corroſive Mercury ſublimate, from which <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> hath been diſtilled, and thereby ſends forth a more ſuffocating ſteam, I ſay, diſtill'd Vinegar being poured thereon and thence diſtilled, doth ſo tame it, that no inoffenſive ſmell doth at all ariſe therefrom.</p>
                  <p>Thus alſo Fire and Salts correct Antimony, as to its Arſenical Sulphur, making it innocent and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, only Diaphoretick in its operation: So fire raiſeth up the flowers thereof, which (by a further ſtrength of the fire) become only a ſweating Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
                  <p>The corroſive Oyl of Antimony, as alſo another <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> almoſt as ſtrong as it ſelf, though they are both very corroſive, yet when mixed together, after their mutual operation upon each other, the corroſive Oyl (by diſtillation) becomes a white powder, which by a ſlight dulcification proves to be an innocent Diaphoretick: Of which, I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently given Twenty four Grains, without any ſenſible operation at all, further then inclining to a breathing ſweat.</p>
                  <p>Some admire the reaſon of the ſtrong ebullition of theſe two mixed together: which are Liquors, as they ſuppoſe, much what of the ſame original; for take (for inſtance) the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth at firſt, in the making of Mercury ſublimate,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41152:101"/>only with this difference, that theſe Spirits ariſe at firſt in a liquid form, whereas the other that come up with the particles of Mercury are coagulated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a dry form of ſublimate; and therefore much what of the ſame original: I ſay, take this <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> pour it upon the butter of Antimony, which is Mercury ſublimate, diſtilled with Antimony, or <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony, and a very ſtrong ebullition happens with a dark red coloured fume. This ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition is not from the conteſt of the Salts, for then the ſame would happen upon the pouring of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> upon Mercury ſublimate (for the Salts in both are the ſame) which I know, upon tryal, it doth not.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is only thus (as I conceive) the Salts in the corroſive Oyl of Antimony, cloſe with the Spirits of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or of Nitre (for the ſame happens to both) and thereby becomes a powerful corroſive, which preſently ſet upon the flowers of the Antimony contained in the butter, do in effect no more than ſo much <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> poured upon crude Antimony (for in both the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible Sulphur is ready to take flame) which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cining, in a humid way, the flagrable Sulphur, burns it off in a dark, thick, horrid fume, even as Tartar and Nitre, by the help of fire, doth burn away that Sulphur in a dry way.</p>
                  <p>After the Sulphur is burnt away by the corroſive Salts, the flowers become fixt into a <hi>Bezoardicum Antimoniale;</hi> which <hi>Menſtruum</hi> being diſtilled off, is ſomewhat yellow, and will diſſolve Gold, which it doth as an <hi>Aqua Regia</hi> of the beſt ſort, having ſome of the body of the Sea-Salt which was carryed over the helm in a complicated form with Mercury, Vitriol, and Nitre: this diſtilled over with the other Salts into a <hi>Butyrum,</hi> cloſe with the Spirits of <hi>Aqua
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41152:102"/>fortis,</hi> or the Nitrous Spirits, calcines the Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and diſtill together in the form of an <hi>Aqua Regia;</hi> and all this by the help of fire.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee a <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of the power of fire, which raiſeth up corroſives, and thoſe corroſives dulcifie one another, and correct Minerals of their Arſenical Sulphurs; and that by the dry and moiſt way, which is ſtill by fire. It fixeth things that are volatile, as for inſtance, Nitre and Arſenick, both which if ſingle are eaſily conſum'd, but joyntly, and helped by the force of fire, the one fixeth the other, and becomes (by dulcification with Spirit of Wine) <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his <hi>Balſamus Fuliginis,</hi> proper againſt <hi>cacoethical</hi> Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>It alſo volatizeth things that are fixed, ſeparates things that are ſeparable, it ſweetens four things, maturates crude things, and haſtens all productions, whether Fruits or Vegetables, to their perfection, or full ſtate of ripeneſs; and therefore unripe Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Apples, Apricocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are by Coddling or Baking ſuddenly dulcified: and Sallads whether Lettuce or other herbs, are made more wholeſom by boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>By a digeſtive heat in cloſe veſſels, cauſtick acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious plants, as <hi>Flamula Jovis, Urtica Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Perſicaria, &amp;c.</hi> become blunted and loſe their ſting; yea, even the ſame happens by bare diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, though no ſtinging or pricking acrimony is at all perceptible in their diſtilled water.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things duly conſidered, will neceſſarily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the extenſiveneſs of the uſe of fire, both as to Food and Medicine. Vegetables are not only crude, but many of them virulent too; and therefore need fire to ripen them, and by correcting their venomous properties to make way for their intrinſick Medical
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41152:102"/>virtues to appear: Alſo Animals communicate not their virtue, which lodge chiefly in the Blood and Urine, unleſs helped by fire, or ferments, or both, whereby their parts become ſeparable, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our mummial ferments.</p>
                  <p>And as for Minerals they are moſt what virulent, and lock'd up; and therefore of neceſſity require a correction and opening of their virtues by the fire: which muſt be done by ſuch degrees of fire as are proportionable to the ſtrictneſs of the texture of their bodies, and to the prevalency of their virulent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, which cannot be done by ſuch gentle ſoſt fires, as Vegetable ſeparations are uſually performed by.</p>
                  <p>It is for the ſake of the unlocking theſe Minerals, that the great ſtreſs of fire is ſo frequently us'd in the Chymical <hi>Analyſis</hi> of them; which gives cauſe to the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> to accuſe <hi>Spagyrical</hi> Preparations, with being too much fired: which how frivolouſly grounded, Let all that have skill therein, judge.</p>
                  <p>For a ſtrong fire is as requiſite, in ſome Mineral Preparations, as a mild fire to ſome eaſie Vegetable ſeparations; the one altogether as proper and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as the other. Would not a Cook-Maid be accus'd of ignorance, if ſhe intending to Roaſt a joynt of meat, ſhould lay it down at a diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate diſtance from an ordinary fire, thinking to take a longer time to do it in? Surely if the diſtance from the fire was ſuch as only to warm the meat gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would not for many days, and (for ought I know) never Roaſt; but would dry up, become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid, and turn to a kind of mummial fleſh.</p>
                  <p>For as I apprehend, Roaſting of meat is perform'd thus, <hi>viz.</hi> When the meat is plac'd at ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent diſtance, as that the fire penetrating the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41152:103"/>midſt thereof, forceth forth the crude blood and moiſture from all parts; which meeting with freſh aſſaults of fiery particles, are driven back again, and ſearch all cavities of the fleſh, thereby matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the rawneſs thereof: which if the meat be taken whil'ſt this moiſture remains, and yet thoroughly penetrated by the digeſting particles of fire, it is then ſapid, ſweet, and ſavory; but if this be ſpent, and the meat yet kept longer at the fire, then it begins to be burnt, and thereby becomes taſtleſs: but if it be perform'd by a pretty quick fire, it's the ſooneſt and beſt done. So in Baking of Bread, if the Oven be not throughly heated, the bread will remain dough, and not wholeſom for food. Though theſe be home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Examples, yet are they ſufficient to demonſtrate the neceſſity of degrees of fire, to be us'd according to the ſtrictneſs or remiſsneſs of the texture of the body, applicable thereto. Beſides I look upon my ſelf here, as ſpeaking to thoſe who need familiar compariſons, to convince them thereby of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſtrong fires in ſome caſes; for to thoſe acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Chymical Preparations, theſe are ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>Again, What Preparations are there in Shops, which have undergone the fire, but are Chymically Prepared; and yet no leſs (notwithſtanding) uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in order to the removing of Diſeaſes? What are all the Spirits and Cordial-waters, but Chymical Separations of Urinous Spirits, marryed with the tinctures and odours of Aromaticks: and that by diſtillation by the fire? What are the beſt of their Purging Pills, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Extractum Rudii,</hi> but a Chymical Extraction of the tinctures of ſo many Vegetables (as is requiſite thereto) by a good recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Spirit of Wine, which if neatly done, and drawn
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41152:103"/>off in <hi>Balneo</hi> (as I do in the making it for my own uſe upon occaſion) and the fixed Salt of the ſpecies after calcination and ſeparation thereof, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united with its extract, is not only Chymical, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared by the fire, but the very beſt amongſt the Shop-Purges.</p>
                  <p>What are the beſt Emeticks or Vomitings in the Shops, but ſuch as are Chymically Prepared, and that by force of fire too? Witneſs the infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metalorum</hi> and <hi>Mercurius Vitae:</hi> The one is prepared by fire and Salts, out of Antimony (which we call <hi>Hepar Antimonii</hi> from the Hepatick colour thereof) whereby the external malignant Sulphur of the Antimony, is moſtwhat conſumed.</p>
                  <p>The other is prepared by fire and Salts out of Mercury and Antimony, but conſiſts chiefly (if not ſolely) of the flowers of Antimony incorporated with the Salt in the Mercury ſublimate, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over together in a glacial Oyl: For in an accurate obſervation of a diſtillation thereof, with ſublimate and <hi>Regulus</hi> of Antimony (which ſublimate we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made, and ſo knew the quantity of Mercury therein) we in a manner got all our Mercury current again, and of Eighteen Ounces of <hi>Regulus,</hi> we had but ſix Ounces or ſcarce ſo much left in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put mort.</hi> Which very Experiment makes me cloſe with <hi>Barthius,</hi> who concludes this gummous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor to be the Reguline parts of Antimony; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Gluckradius</hi> who would have it to be from Mercury, affirming that the Antimony only by its addition helps the fuſion and liquefaction of the Mercury in its diſtillation; and againſt <hi>Bilichius</hi> too, who, with <hi>Gluckradius,</hi> would have it to be nothing elſe but Mercury, brought over in a glaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Oyl, by the help of Salts, ſo as the Antimony
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41152:104"/>onely contributes towards the liquidneſs of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, as bole, ſand, earth, or the like doth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the diſtillations of Salts, with which they are us'd as a <hi>Retinaculum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But our Experiment doth wholy thwart this, for out of three Pound of ſublimate (in which, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, we find about Twelve Ounces of Quickſilver in each Pound) and Eighteen Ounces of the <hi>Regulus</hi> Antimony, we had one Pound an half of the Oyl, two Pound and about four Ounces of current Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and in the <hi>Caput mort</hi> ſcarce ſix Ounces: here the whole weight of the matter we took, was four Pounds two Ounces, anſwerable to which, we got one Pound and half of Oyl, two Pound four Ounces of Quickſilver, and ſix ounces in the <hi>Caput mort;</hi> in all four Pounds two Ounces: ſo that we loſt nothing.</p>
                  <p>Now how ſhould Mercury make up the body of this Oyl, when we got it in a manner all current a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as it was at firſt before ſublimation, with Salts? And why ſhould not the <hi>Regulus</hi> make up the body thereof with the Salts? Seeing we loſt Twelve Ounces of the <hi>Regulus</hi> which muſt needs make up this butter; for that quantity of <hi>Regulus</hi> which we found defective in the bottom of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, together with as much of the Salts out of the Sublimate, made up the whole of the butter <hi>(viz)</hi> one Pound and an half.</p>
                  <p>Again, Whence ſhould proceed the ſtrong Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous fumes, upon the pouring of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> or Spirit of Nitre thereon, but from the Sulphur of the Antimony, which it has in greater plenty than quick Mercury has. Beſides if the white powder, <hi>viz. Mercurius Vitae</hi> (ſo called) be put into a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and try'd further by the fire; we have obſerv'd
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41152:104"/>it to flow and fume; over which fume, though we directly plac'd a <hi>Spatula,</hi> yet have we not diſcovered the leaſt minute particle of Mercury thereon: which from other vulgar Preparations of Mercury, brought to the teſt of fire in a crucible, we found particles of current Mercury, <hi>viz.</hi> from Mercury precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, Turbith Mineral, factitious <hi>Cinnabar, Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riùs dulcis,</hi> Mercury ſublimate, all which gave a <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of the body of Mercury, but this of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Vitae</hi> none, but melted into a kind of <hi>Stibium</hi> or black glaſs, in the ſame manner as any common preparation of Antimony will do.</p>
                  <p>As to the main argument <hi>Bilichius</hi> brings, which is, <hi>Ego quoque</hi> inquit <hi>Mercurium vitae, pulviſculo Tartari purificati permixtum, &amp; modico, attamen diuturno calore in arena exercitum, vidi Liquoris aeterni guttulam unam atque alteram ſudaſſe:</hi> which I rather judge might be a particle or two of the Mercury of Antimony, than of the vulgar Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, at firſt contained in the ſublimate; for it is the very way, at leaſt analogous, to that which ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pround, towards the getting the Mercury of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony.</p>
                  <p>Yet we cannot but admire at that wonderful ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof, which <hi>Bilichius</hi> (and beſides him none that I know) takes notice.

                  <p>So that both theſe foreſaid Preparations, which are the chief Emeticks of the Shops, are, I ſay, both out of Antimony, which very Mineral is that the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> ſo deeply accuſe, and tell their Patients how dangerous a thing it is, and that they will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no ſuch dangerous Ingredient; when perhaps the next preſcription will be infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or ſome few Grains of <hi>Antimonium Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticum,</hi> or the like: not to mention here the <hi>Sal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioli</hi> or the <hi>Gilla Theophraſti,</hi> which they ſeldom preſcribe, either becauſe they have them not, or know not their virtues.</p>
                  <p>What is their beſt Medicine for worms, which they alſo frequently uſe againſt venereal Diſeaſes, but a Chymical Preparation called <hi>Mercurius dulcis?</hi> Made out of Mercury (another Mineral (or rather Metal) they inveigh againſt) and that too out of the moſt corroſive ſublimate, than which (ſave the Oyl of Antimony) nothing is more deſperately corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and yet out of this corroding product of Salts, Mercury, and Fire, with the help of more Mercury and the further uſe of Fire, is This innocent harmleſs
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41152:105"/>Medicine, Chymically Prepared, which is ſo ſafe, as is frequently given to Children againſt the Worms; and that (ſo the Doſe be duely ordered) without the leaſt harm, as all thoſe who uſe it can teſtifie, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Preparation be rightly done.</p>
                  <p>What are the fixt Salts in the Shops, as of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, Wormwood, Broom, Scurvy-graſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Chymical products made by force of fire? For the fire, eſpecially the naked force thereof, ſeparates all ſeparable parts; and in the actual flagration, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Salt takes hold of the Sulphur, the one bears down the other by force, to ſuffer all the injury the flames can do, and ſo become fixed together, whence proceeds the <hi>ſaponaryneſs</hi> of all fix'd Salts: and that it is the Vegetable Salt (which while it's in the Concrete, before any violence be done, is neither fix'd nor volatile) which catching hold of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur in the flagration of the Plant, that gives ſtrength to the Salt, is apparent, becauſe in the burning of Vegetables for to get (or rather to make) their fix'd Salts, if it be done whilſt the Plant is in its full ſtrength, before it begin to ſpend it ſelf into ſeed, the more in quantity, and the ſtronger, is the Salt found to be <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore thoſe who burn Brakes for their aſhes to make Bale-ſoap of, do it while they are green and ſtrong, cutting them down, and then give fire to them, and ſo let them burn in great heaps, with a ſmothering fire: Thus the Vegetable Salt catcheth hold of the Sulphur, and both being in their full ſtrength, the one bears down the other, and gives a great quantity of Salt; whereas if they ſhould let them alone till they turn yellow, and then burn them, they would not get (as they find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) half ſo much Salt.</p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:41152:106"/>
                  <p>The like ſhould be obſerved in the burning of all Plants for their Salts, to take them at ſuch a maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as before they be impoveriſhed by waſting their ſtrength in ſeed, for at the time of ſeeding of Plants, the eſſential Salt, by a further digeſtive ferment, connatural to the Plant, becomes tranſmuted (for the moſt part) into a Sulphur, which gives an Oyl: and therefore Plants, during the time of their ſeed, yield Oyl moſt plentifully.</p>

                  <p>For this Eſſential Salt, in its circuit of Vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſſumes the form of Sulphur, at due ſeaſons; yea, is actually tranſmutable thereinto. Whence it is, that the more Plants yield of an Eſſential Oyl, the leſs they give of Salt, either fix'd or volatile; ſo that Salts and Sulphurs, are but the various diſguiſes of ſeed: and therefore may give hint to ingenuous ſearchers, how to turn Salts into Oyls, and by a further inſpection, how to reduce Oyls into Salts, which thereby (as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith) becomes noble, temperate, abſterſive, penetrative and balſamick Remedies.</p>

                  <p>What are all the Eſſential Oyls of the Shops, ſuch as of Roſemary, Sage, Wormwood, Cloves, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, Cinnamon, <hi>Saſſafras, Rudium, &amp;c.</hi> but Chymical Diſtillations; of the Sulphurs of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Aromaticks?

                  <p>So that, if we take a ſummary account of all the diſpenſatory Medicines, and make a ſeparation of all the Chymical Preparations, from the reſt of the farragmous compoſitions, we ſhall find (if any thing conſiderable be done in the Cure of Diſeaſes) it is chiefly effected by the Chymical Preparations, though they themſelves in reſpect of the more noble Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Arcana,</hi> are but Preparations of a lower rank: The reſt as Syrups, Conſerves, Electuaries, <hi>

                  <p>If the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> would but in prove that ſhall ſtock they have of Chymical Remedies, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring to graduate them further, by the help of fire and ferments, they would nor onely, not quarrel with the Chymical Practice of Phyſick; but alſo find that whatever of excellency was perform'd, in order to the Cure of Diſeaſes, would really be moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from ſuch Preparations. A right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, would compoſe them in their heat, and ſwellings, againſt Chymical Phyſick; and make them ingenuouſly confeſs their former ignorance: and at length acknowledge the wrong they have done to that noble Science, by accuſing its Medical Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Empyreumatiſm.</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:41152:107"/>
                  <p>For by a little experience therein, they would learn to know, the degrees of fire ſutable to the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Concretes, brought to the teſt thereof; and that no leſs alterations are made (in bodies adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto) by gentle fires of digeſtions, and eaſie diſtillations: than by more ſtrong fires in operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon more <hi>robuſt</hi> bodies.

                  <head>The Solution of the ſecond Objection.</head>
                  <p n="45">45. AN other thing, wherewith they impeach Chymical Phyſicians, is, That they are not methodical, but empirical in their practice. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer therefore to which, we firſt Query, Whether that be not the beſt method, which Cures Diſeaſes beſt, according to that ternary of <hi>eitò, tutò, &amp; jucundè?</hi> Whether the <hi>Galenical</hi> or Chymical Phyſician doth perform this the beſt, is the diſpute. The next
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41152:107"/>Query is, Whether to be ſo accurate, in the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual obſervation, of all the injunctions of the Schools, be altogether, or at all neceſſary to make a Phyſician cure Diſeaſes the more ſucceſsfully?</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt. I ſay, The Methodiſts, I mean the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> do pretend to a method in the curing of Diſeaſes, according to the level of which, they pretend alſo to anſwer all indications, which gives yet further to Query, Whether this method they ſo much admire, be not more directed to the mitigating of the Luxuriant Symptomes, <hi>viz.</hi> the lopping off the branches, than to the immediate encountring with the eſſential cauſe of the Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtubbing it up by the roots? I mean, Whether (ſuppoſe in any particular Diſeaſe; for inſtance a Fever) their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod doth not more aim at the ſuppreſſion of the Symptomes, <hi>viz.</hi> the heat, thirſt, want of reſt, pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Phlebotomy, cooling Juleps, Emulſions, frequent Purgations, <hi>Laudanum,</hi> and the like; than, I ſay, at the eſſential cauſe, which lies in the initials of the ſpurious fermentation of the blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo conſequently level their Medicines in their methodical rank and file, againſt the poſterior pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and branches of the Diſeaſe, rather than againſt the Diſeaſe it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>For unleſs the <hi>Theory</hi> of the Diſeaſes were certain and infallible, the method of practice grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be ſatisfactory to any ingenuous man; for if he eſpy a flaw in the method, by obſerving it, for the moſt part, not anſwering his expectation in the cure of Diſeaſes, it will give him juſt cauſe to ſuſpect an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the <hi>Theory:</hi> and by that time begin to queſtion both; yea, and lay them aſide too, if he can but diſcern another more probable <hi>Theory,</hi> whoſe conſequent practice, doth more certainly inable him to cure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes more happily.</p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:41152:108"/>
                  <p>Now to be better convinced of the inefficacy of the <hi>Galenical</hi> method in the curing Diſeaſes, Let us conſider how often, in moſt Chronical Diſeaſes (for in acute they have not that time) is their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod baffled. How frequently do they run over the ſame courſe of Phyſick, even till the Patient is tired out and out, having their vital Principles more really weakened, and linger in an hopeleſs manner, under the tyranny of the Diſeaſe; and after all this, that the Methodiſts have ſpun out, their longeſt thred and left them, ſome honeſt Country-man or good old woman hath a ſpecifick Remedy, which they have known, by experience, to have done good in the like caſe: and the Patient is now (though not before) at leiſure to try it, takes it, and though his or her skill is not ſo good as to give it with ſuch advantage, as ſome congruous circumſtances might ſecond it withal, yet (I ſay) often ſucceeds; and cures the lingring Patient of his Diſeaſe, made worſe by a method.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe he which gave this Remedy, did it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the formality of a method, if by the good ſucceſs thereof, he be encouraged to give it frequently, he gains the name of an Empirick, <hi>viz</hi> one who gives a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at random, without a method, or without being able to give a reaſon for the operation of his Medicine. Whereas indeed if we make a ſcrutiny into the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reaſons of the operation of Medicines, I am apt to queſtion whether any Methodiſt, can give a ſolid ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory reaſon, of the operation of any one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine he gives, in his whole method; and that, becauſe the reaſons and cauſes of things are ſo very abſtruſe, as <hi>Jurare in verba Magiſtri,</hi> to ſubſcribe to the <hi>placets</hi> of other men, is not enough, to any ingenuous man, to ſatisfie himſelf in the reaſons of things, attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereby.</p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:41152:108"/>
                  <p>And if I ſhould Query, why the infuſion of <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium</hi> or of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> ſhould operate by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and Stool? And why the ſame if further prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the fire and ſalts, ſhould operate by Sweat?</p>
                  <p>And to the firſt it be anſwered, That it provokes Vomit becauſe it hath an antipathy to, and diſagrees with the ſtomach. This would be no ſufficient reaſon, becauſe many other things may have an antipathy to the ſtomach, and yet not cauſe Vomit; but may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rouze up an incoercible <hi>flatus,</hi> or may march off by Stool. So that for things to diſagree with the ſtomach, is neither the real cauſe of Vomiting or Purging; though it is true, there muſt of neceſſity be a concomitant diſagreement of the thing with the ſtomach: But what that is that makes the antipathy, is the thing in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>To ſay that a Vomiting meeting with vitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours upon the ſtomach, diſſolves them; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the expulſive facultie of the Stomach, forceth them up by Vomit, is ſtill no ſufficient reaſon or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Queſtion: For, What can one Ounce of Wine, only impregnate with a Mineral odour, do, as to the diſſolving of corrupt humours upon the Stomach, and to provoke the expulſive faculty with ſuch violence, as by the convulſive motions of the ſtomach, to throw up what is in the concave thereof? What are the humours of the ſtomach to it? It's in taſte and colour, almoſt the ſame, with ſo much ſimple Wine. How ſhould the expulſive faculty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thereby concern'd, unleſs we have recourſe to what we ſaid before, <hi>viz.</hi> the antipathy thereof with the ſtomach or <hi>Regent</hi> powers thereof; And ſo be at as great a loſs ſtill, as to a true Solution of the Query, as before.</p>
                  <p>As to what the Atomical Philoſophers ſay in this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41152:109"/>caſe, I am not ſatisfied, that they give a reſolve to the Point; who would have all ſuch actions of Vomiting and Purging, to be performed by the concourſe of various ſiz'd particles, acted by different motions: which impreſſing the like motions upon the nervous and membranous parts, cauſe that <hi>Syſtole</hi> or convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motion of the ſtomach; which by compreſſing and contracting it ſelf, throws up what is contained therein. Who though they go on ſlily and cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the weaving their Atomical texture of bodies, and make all Creatures to be but as ſo many <hi>Automa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's;</hi> who like a Clock, or Watch-work, being once wound up, keep going from their Springie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of motion: Methinks, they do as much <hi>petere principium,</hi> as the former, in that they take it for granted, that what we call Life, is nothing elſe but a reſult of motion and figure, in all bodies. For though all bodies as to the whole, and to every ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part, are conſtituted of form or ſhape, and acted by motion, as the body ſtands inclined to its <hi>Geneſis</hi> or <hi>Analyſis</hi> whereby all things are in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Flux, and conſtant tranſmutation: Yet this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth not motion and figure to be the cauſe of that we call Life, or, as they ſay, that there is no other exiſtence of any <hi>Anima ſenſitiva</hi> than that, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that motion and figure, are the ſequels of Life: Beſides, methinks, the niceties of vital function, are too curious to be ſolv'd by ſo ſlight an <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again if we endevour to anſwer the Query, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Chymiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the odour of the combuſtible Sulphur of the Antimony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Wine being impregnated, becomes hoſtile to the <hi>Archeus</hi> or <hi>Anima ſenſitiva,</hi> which hath its chief reſidence in the ſtomach; which being provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ceaſeth not by oppoſition to that which offends,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41152:109"/>not only to through it off, but alſo the depraved hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which lie faſt impacted in the tunicles of the ſtomach. Which indeed is a fine notion, and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to be near the truth, yet, to me, the ſame Query remains as indemonſtrated as in the former, <hi>viz.</hi> How rationally it gives a ſatisfactory account, Why the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of <hi>Stibium</hi> ſhould act as an Emetick rather than any other way? What do we know, what this odour of the Sulphur of Antimony is? And why the <hi>Anima ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiva</hi> ſhould rather be offended than pleaſed thereat?</p>
                  <p>I ſay, how difficult a thing would it have been, to have given a rational account of the manner of its operation, ſo as to have ſaid, ſo and ſo, according to reaſon, will it work, and this before an experiment thereof had been made; for when we ſee a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to work by Vomit or Stool or Sweat, we then preſently fall to conjecture the reaſon thereof.</p>
                  <p>But for one to have according to rational Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, predicted that <hi>Scamony, Colocynthis, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, &amp;c.</hi> would Purge; and that before ever they had been found ſo to do, by experiment, would have been a ſatisfactory evincement of the reaſon of the thing: but this is more competible to the intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive cognition of the immortal Soul, whoſe out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is pure reaſon; And therefore while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in theſe miſts of the body, we muſt deſcend to a lower order of reaſon. Whereas in the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> in that part thereof call'd <hi>Algebra,</hi> there are ſome <hi>Petita</hi> that ſo the <hi>Quaeſita</hi> may the eaſylier be found out: So likewiſe in the ratiocination, about apparent <hi>Phaenomena's,</hi> there is a neceſſity of laying down ſome <hi>Petita,</hi> which ought to be few, yet fruitful principles, which are indemonſtrable <hi>à priori,</hi> to which all apparencies are ultimately reducible; and by which the <hi>Quaeſita,</hi> things inquired after, may be found out.</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:41152:110"/>
                  <p>Theſe pregnant Principles ought to be grounded on ſolid experiments, towards which, the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> are performing a conſiderable work; in gathering experiments of all ſorts; out of which, in tract of time, a noble demonſtrative Science may be raiſed up.</p>
                  <p>Now, That ſenſe and motion are the product and ſequel of Life, and not the Life it ſelf, nor cauſe thereof, the Life only ſhould (as I apprehend) be that one primary Principle to which all the <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's,</hi> or apparencies thereof are reducible; which being ſimple, and ſimple in it ſelf, hath all fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, digeſtions, motions, ſenſe and heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſubſervient thereunto: All which as inſtruments, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the various functions thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now, that ſenſe and motion, are but the ſequel of the <hi>Anima ſenſitiva</hi> (that <hi>Regent</hi> Spirit, unto which the whole oeconomy of the body is ſubſervient) is obvious in a Paralytick and Apoplectick Diſtemper; where ſometimes ſenſe remains, and motion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd; otherwhiles there is motion and no ſenſe, and yet Life is preſent; yea ſometimes in Hyſterical Diſeaſes, both ſenſe and motion are aboliſht for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the body lieth as dead: and yet Life ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were in its embers, or in a crude ſmoak, by a Ray, from the immortal, which hath wrapt up the mortal Soul, darting from the heart, becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled, takes flame, and lives again, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the beholders.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſenſe and motion in violent Hyſterical Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath been ſo much deprav'd, as able Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have ſometimes given them over for dead; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that a great Phyſician and skilful Anatomiſt, coming to a Woman, who was ſuppos'd to be dead, and being deſirous to inform himſelf of the cauſe of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41152:110"/>ſo ſuddain a death, attempts to Anatomize her, who upon the very firſt touch of his diſſecting knife, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly ſtarted up; which ſo terrified this Maſter of Anatomy, that he could ſcarce recover-himſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how after all his skill and diligence in that Art, he ſhould be ſo deceived, as to offer at the diſſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a living woman: which ſtruck him with diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and taking it to heart, deſpaired, and died.</p>
                  <p>And as ſenſe and motion, ſo alſo fermentation and heat; alſo chuſing, and eſchewing that which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and diſagreeable, are the products of Life: Whence alſo to raiſe a ſtructure of reaſon, why ſome things work by Vomit, other things by Purge; though it may be plauſible to ſome, yet wilk not be ſatisfactory to others.</p>
                  <p>That three or four Grains of <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> ſhould work ſo ſtrongly by Vomit, and as many Grains, of the extract of <hi>Colocynthis,</hi> ſhould work ſo forcibly by Stool, cannot rationally be imputed to any other efficient, but that <hi>Spiritus impetum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clens</hi> of <hi>Hippoorates,</hi> upon which theſe violent Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Catharticks ſeizing, by the diſguſt the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chous</hi> or <hi>Anima ſenſitiva,</hi> takes at that which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile thereto which yet how to deſcribe we cannot tell) rouzeth up a ſpurious fermentation of the humours of the ſtomach and Inteſtines, which if ſtrong, works up by Vomit, as is apparent in the adminiſtring of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum, viz.</hi> That, while the <hi>Regent</hi> Spirit of the Stomach, is moſt provoked by the force of the Emetick, it cauſeth ſuch an hoſtile fermentation, which reacheth even to the bottom and round the ſides of the ſtomach, till it forceth up the Emetick Wine, and with it the humours into which, it, as a ferment, hath wrought it ſelf, and ſo nature disburdens it ſelf of two Enemies at once; after
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41152:111"/>the violence of this emetick fermentation is over; that which remains, gliding through the <hi>Pylorus</hi> into the Inteſtines, doth there cauſe a further fermentation in the juyces therein contained, and ſo paſſeth off by ſiedge.</p>
                  <p>Now all Solutives operate one of theſe three ways, either as they are abſterſwes, which raze off the <hi>ſordes</hi> from the ſides of the primary veſſels; of which ſort are all abſterſive Salts, ſuch as have a ſapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Alkali,</hi> waſh off the adherent <hi>ſordes:</hi> and theſe are the eſſential Salt of Tartar, and ſometimes the volatile Salts of Urine or Harts-horn, as alſo the <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> acuated or extracted with the Solution of the eſſential Salt of Tartar, in the <hi>alcool</hi> of Spirit of Wine, and chiefly the volatile Spirit of Salt of Tartar.</p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, Solutives operate as they remind the digeſtions of their offices, of which ſort are <hi>Pilulae Ruffi, Pilulae Aloephanginae,</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Pills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taken in a ſmall Doſe; which, though they are not properly ſuch Solutives, yet are pretty innocent <hi>Succedavea's:</hi> but above all, the <hi>Arcanum Coralli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of <hi>Helmont,</hi> is one of the true Solutives, which only puts the digeſtions in mind of their office, and as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, only Purgeth what is corrupt in the body, not purging at all a ſound body.</p>
                  <p>Or laſtly, Solutives operate by exciting an exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick fermentation in the humours, or fluids of the firſt veſſels, and circumjacent parts; and that either by the virulency of ſome Vegetables ſeated in the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous parts thereof, as of <hi>Scamony, Colocynthis, Jalap, Agarick, Elebor, &amp;c.</hi> or by the odour of the Arſenical Sulphur in Minerals, promoted by the operation of Salts, as of <hi>Mercurius vitae, Crocui Metallorum, Sulphur Antimonii auratum, &amp;c.</hi> All
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41152:111"/>which become fermental in their operation, and if the Doſe and ſtrength of the Patient, be not duely proportion'd by the skill of the Phyſician, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too fermental; not only carrying off all good, and bad humours from the ſtomach, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon paſſages, but alſo by an <hi>Hypercatharſis</hi> colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate the very blood, yea, and ſolid parts too, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a putrilaginous excrement carryed away by Stool.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that by the fermental venom of theſe Drugs badly prepared, and as unskilfully adminiſtred, that incredible number of Vomits and Stools, or only of Stools, happen ſometimes to Patients, giving them Thirty, Forty, Fifty or Sixty Stools, even almoſt to an exhauſting of the very ſtrength of the body; which is done by an impreſſing, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt indeleble venenous Character of the virulent Drug upon the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> which at firſt, working forth all the contained humours of the firſt paſſages, and ſtill retaining the ſame fermental impreſſion, to which as a virulent thorn in the part, all the other humours whether blood or other liquids, have their conflux, endevouring thereby to waſh off the veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſtain; but not being able to perform that work, by reaſon of the prevalency thereof, are forthwith tranſmuted into a ſlimy putrilage, with griping pangs at every ſolution, and ſo carryed away by Stool, to the great impoveriſhment of the Spirits and ſtrength of the body: Which ſometimes brings on a ſudden <hi>Tabes</hi> preying upon the very ſolid parts, and thence too haſtens on Death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have a reaſonable account of the manner of the operation of Emeticks and Catharticks; though I dare not be poſitive therein, but only give fair and probable hints, which may perhaps incite ſome others to a further proſecution thereof. Yet
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41152:112"/>how theſe malignant properties in ſome Concretes, and benevolence in others are found out, is better diſcernable by the eye and ſenſe of the <hi>Regent</hi> Spirit of the ſtomach, then that of reaſon; for all are not alike virulent to all: ſo things which are very wholeſom and uſeful to moſt, yet are diſguſted as poyſons to others. How far cuſtom may prevail, as to cauſe ſome to take that quantity of a <hi>Toxicum,</hi> which would inebriate, ſtupefie, or kill another, may hence appear. I have known a man ſo accuſtom himſelf to <hi>Opium,</hi> as that every night he would take Ten, Twelve, or Fifteen Grains thereof; without any previous preparation, which if he neglected to take, he was commonly dull and ſtupifyed the next day; whereas the taking thereof made him chearful and lively, which given to another, would have ſtupified, brought a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or perhaps by the prevalency of the <hi>Toxicum</hi> might have proved mortal: all which are ſcarce ſolvable by the common Principles of the Schools, but are better reducible to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Adage, It was <hi>the nature of the Beaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why Vegetables are found to have ſuch virulent properties, we ſhall not long diſpute. The ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Kircher</hi> in his <hi>Mundus Subterraneus</hi> tells us that they proceed from Mineral Arſenical juyces, ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the earth, where ſuch Vegetable feeds are; which incorporating themſelves therewith, become thereby the Authors of ſuch virulent fermental poyſons, or <hi>Toxicums,</hi> whence <hi>Napellus, Hyoſcyamus, Cicuta, &amp;c.</hi> take their virulency: but I ſhall wave that, leaſt I too much loſe my method.</p>
                  <p>If the reaſons of things be ſo abſtruſe, as I have before ſhewed, I mean, the true cauſe of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Medicines, be ſo difficult to underſtand; and that the very beſt knowledge we attain to therein,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41152:112"/>is taken from and grounded upon experiments or tryals: and that theſe experiments are as likely to fall into the obſervation of thoſe who are ignorant of a method, as of thoſe who are skilful therein, What advantage there hath a Methodiſt, whoſe very grounds and Principles are either found unſucceſsful in practice, or muchwhat contradicted by Experience the grand Miſtreſs of Knowledge?</p>
                  <p>For the order of our knowledge is inverted, ſince it was intuitive, ſince now we only know <hi>à poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori</hi> from the products and effects of things; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as then we know from the very eſſential cauſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So that now experiment is the road to knowledge; all other (except that which is Divine) being moſtwhat conjectural, and therefore fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe if we were more Empirical, <hi>viz.</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd more to tryals and obſervations of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (though under a mean form) about Concretes of this nature, we ſhould probably be more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Curing of Diſeaſes, be better Phyſicians', though perhaps leſs methodical; and that, becauſe nature in the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Diſeaſes, and Cures thereof, is not tyed to any of our preſcribed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, though never ſo ſpecious: but our method or manner of ordering due applications for natures help, ought rather to be confin'd to the laws and poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nature, and to good collateral obſervations from ſucceſsful experiments.</p>
                  <p>To which purpoſe it doth not at all miſ-become a Phyſician to enquire into experiments of all ſorts of this nature, even from circumforaneous, Empiricks, Quacks, Barber-Chyrurgeons, old Wives, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryers, Midwives, or from any other perſons, to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41152:113"/>whom experiments of this kind may happen: By whoſe ingenuous obſervation from ſuch like ordinary Peoples experiments, no ſmall light happens to the more ready Curing of Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>For from ſuch Perſons (if credible) you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but naked matter of experimenty unaſſiſted by Art; which often, becauſe ſimple, and therefore more ſingly co-operative with nature, proves more efficacious in performing Cures, than the ſplendid <hi>Recipes</hi> of moſt fam'd Phyſicians: and that becauſe theſe are ſo learn'd, as that it would ſeem (as they ſuppoſe) ridiculous to inſiſt upon one, two, or three Ingredients (and perhaps thoſe but of ordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count neither) for them to preſcribe to a Patient.</p>
                  <p>And probably one reaſon, why great Phyſicians are often ſo unſucceſsful in their Cures, though they attempt them by ſome ſuch Concretes, as they hear a fortunate report of, is, becauſe they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the ſimple Remedy they heard of, but adding this and the other, and a third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of ſuch as they think have the like qualities (according to that ſaying, <hi>Vis unita fortior</hi>) do ſo confound the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with their additionals, as they quite ſpoyl the operation of its genuine efficacy.</p>
                  <p>So that one may certainly conclude, that that manner, way, or method, which Cures Diſeaſes moſt happily, ſooner, and with leſs trouble, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitation of Spirits, is the beſt; which muſt be ſuch as is moſtwhat grounded upon collateral obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of ſucceſsful experiments, and not from far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raginons <hi>Recipes</hi> in Books: and whether Chymical Phyſicians are the moſt likely to perform this, I ſhall refer to the judicious Reader. And this brings me to the other Query, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether to be ſo accurate, in the punctual obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41152:113"/>of all the injunctions of the Schools be altogether or at all neceſſary to make a Phyſician cure Diſeaſes the more ſucceſsfully?</p>
                  <p>When I conſider the tedious and almoſt inextrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Labyrinth, wherein young Phyſicians are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly involv'd. How many great Volumes of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Hippocrates, Dioſcorides, Actuarius, Raſis, Serapio, Aetius, Averrhoes, Heurnius, Fernelius, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus, Riverius, cum multis aliis,</hi> they revolve? What tedious pieces of Anatomy of <hi>Velſingius, Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus, Bartholinus, Spigelius, Pareus, &amp;c.</hi> do they peruſe? How many unprofitable Diſcourſes, for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation ſake, in the Theory of Phyſick, are they ingag'd in? How many hundreds of Plants do they burden their Memory withal? And that both as to their form, which muſt be, as well when the Vegetables are young, as when come to maturity, together with ſome ſlight touch of their Virtues, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſuperficial deſcription of the Herbals? What a confus'd jumble of the varieties of Pulſes, do they puzzle their heads withal? What a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Symptomes, good and bad? What long Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes of differences of Urine? And to confirm all this, What long Pilgrimages into <hi>Italy</hi> and to the Univerſities there, muſt they make? And returning home after all this, cannot (as ſome of them have ingenuouſly confeſs'd, and the Country-People brought to the teſt) certainly Cure one poor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, when I conſider all theſe things, I cannot but wonder and ſay <hi>Quorſum haec omnia?</hi> What's the meaning of all this noiſe, and yet ſo little Wool? I mean, ſuch a deal of doe to inform our judgments, and yet nothing the nearer to cure Diſeaſes; being only inabled hereby, to diſcourſe learnedly with
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41152:114"/>other Phyſicians, and with a great deal of elegancy, read a Lecture to the Patient of his Diſeaſe, that it is in this, and the other part, and proceeds from Phlegmatick, Cholerick, or <hi>Aduſt</hi> humours, or the complications thereof; whilſt the poor languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Patient crys, <hi>Give a Remedy, or elſe I dye.</hi> Thus they prove too eloquent to a languiſhing Patient, who had much rather hear of a good ſutable Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, than to be tantaliz'd with learned Diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>Young Students in other Countries, commonly go along with a learned Profeſſor, to whom he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reads Lectures, upon the ſick Patients he viſits; and doth it with ſuch a grave method of Diſcourſe, pointing out the Symptomes, anſwerable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of ſuch and ſuch humours; and that in ſo learned a ſtyle, meaſuring out the lineaments and dimenſions of the Diſeaſe in its riſe, ſtate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion, as that the young Students do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (if their method of Medicine be but anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of their Theory) that none of theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes can come amiſs to them, but they ſhall ſurely cure them all.</p>
                  <p>But alas! When they come to matter of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Practice, they find, they are miſtaken, they are puzzled at every turn; and ſome of them, that are moſt ingenuouſly inclin'd, begin to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the emptineſs of their learned Theory, and of the barrenneſs of their fruitleſs method: and that in truth and good earneſt, they are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly able to perform the cure of any Diſeaſe, not ſo much (as ſome of them have acknowledged) as a <hi>Paronychia</hi> or Whitlow.</p>
                  <p>To what purpoſe are the various Diſcourſes of Phyſick, and that in a methodical way <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con?</hi> aſſerting this and denying the other, troubling the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41152:114"/>heads of Practitioners with empty ſpeculations, which are no ſooner conceived, but before they are well brought forth, are ready to be ſtrangled, even in the birth, with other equally, or more rational apprehenſions, and all this but in a putationary; and conſequently deceitful Philoſophy, whoſe principles not being grounded upon experiment, prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves meerly fictitious, and at the beſt uncertain.</p>
                  <p>What ſatisfaction can an ingenuous man take, from the manifold Doctrine of Pulſes? Which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther irregular and uncertain. What great number of their difference is ſet down? Enough to fright a man, at the firſt ſight, from vexing himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. How cumberſome to the Memory, are the very terms of Art? Which alone were enough to make up a Science, ſufficiently troubleſome to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the Memory, yea and ſometimes put it upon the rack too.</p>
                  <p>How do young Students trifle a great part of their time away at the Univerſities, in the froathy Study of Logicks, Ethicks, Phyſicks, and Metaphyſicks? And all this in order (to thoſe who bend their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that way) to Medicks? From which beſides the empty ſpeculations and verbal janglings, little of worth doth thence proceed; And what is the reaſon? Only this, That they have not ſufficient matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in their Phyſicks, to ground a true Science upon; and as to Ethicks, they more conſult the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and moralities of the Heathen, than the Life of CHRIST and Chriſtians: The other two are meerly verbal, conjectural, and moſtwhat chymerical.</p>
                  <p>If they would more liſten to a grand collection of experiments of all ſorts, according to the Lord <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulam</hi>'s advice, and totally ceaſe from all manner of diſputations; improving all other parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41152:115"/>to the utmoſt, It would be the only way in tract of time, to eſtabliſh a true ſolid Science of Philoſophy; till then, we may expect no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble improvement, in thoſe places, of real Science.</p>
                  <p>How uncertain are Phyſicians in their diagnoſticks of Diſeaſes? In ſo much, as ſo many Phyſicians, ſo many ſeveral judgements of the ſame numerical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; and all this for want of ſome pregnant Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, grounded upon ſolid experiment, which in time would beget a demonſtrable Science; without which, they erre in uncertainties, are moſtwhat ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrical to the truth, and having no firm footing for want of a true baſis of experiments, ſlide too and again amongſt ſlippery notions.</p>
                  <p>To be ſo accurately skilful in Anatomy, as to be able to read a Lecture upon a cut finger, is not very neceſſary; to know the Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Muſcles and Bones by name, that are cut, is more burdenſom then uſeful to ſtretch our memories, with a great catalogue of ſimples, and to know ſo many hundreds or perhaps a thouſand by their heads, both in their Infancy and Maturity, brings a Phyſician no nearer to know ſpecificks, in order to the cure of Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>To be deeply vers'd in the knowledg of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agnoſticks of diſeaſes, of all good and bad Symptomes, reckoned, by <hi>Galen, Hippocrates, &amp;c.</hi> onely inable a man to be confident, and thereby to commit folly, by being too poſitive in his determinations of Life and Death; and ſo expoſe himſelf, and all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Phyſick, to an ignominious report amongſt the vulgar.</p>
                  <p>The confidence of ſome Phyſicians herein, I have much admired, who truſting too much to their own skill, and being too credulous of the ſmiles of ſome
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41152:115"/>flattering, though uncertain, ſymptomes, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly (at leaſt frequently) predict Life and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, with ſuch like expreſſions as theſe, <hi>I wiſh I had a Leaſe of the Patients Life. My Life for his, He or ſhe will recover. He may live many Years. He is ſafe, &amp;c.</hi> when the very next news we hear, is, The Patient's dead, the Leaſe is out, the Years are expired in one or two days time, and the Phyſician's Life and Credit is forfeited: Nay, and which is worſe than all this, the Phyſician will keep the ſame ſhare of confidence ſtill, and be as forward in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of Life and Health, and to the next Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as before, though perhaps, yea frequently with as bad ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>I do think, that they eſteem it below them, for the vulgar not to judge, but that they have all the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Diſeaſe, or not to think, but that they know the height, depth, and length, and know the limits of its <hi>exit.</hi> And to ſettle this opinion in the vulgar, that they may be reputed Maſters of their Profeſſion, they put it to a venture, predict very confidently of Life or Death, which like a Lottery ſometimes hits, and then their fame becomes wing'd amongſt the ignorant ſort of People, but if it miſs, as it is very probable it may, yea frequently doth; then they huddle it up, and a little time wears it off, that it is forgot both by themſelves and others: yet this confidence being ſo obvious cannot eaſily be ſinothered in all breaſts, eſpecially in thoſe who are ſomewhat deeper ſighted than the reſt, to whom ſuch vain confidence gives occaſion to ſuſpect, that either the Phyſician predicts Life to pleaſe the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Friends about him, or that through a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ignorance, he rapps at the prediction, and at a venture, becauſe he would have it ſo, ſaith aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41152:116"/>his Life for his, he will Live and Recover: after all which, with many other circumſtantials of his confidence, nothing is more frequent, than that the Patient dies. This makes Phyſicians a by-word amongſt the vulgar, and gives occaſion to other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Perſons to conclude that Phyſick, as it is generally practiced, is nothing but a meer quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a grand juggle, impos'd upon the vulgar, and others of inferior capacities; which gave occaſion to one ingenious Perſon to ſay, That three grand Impoſters of the World, in that Art, died in one Year; which was <hi>Riverius,</hi> Sir <hi>Theodore Mayhern,</hi> who the third was I know not.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how injurious confident Phyſicians are to their own Art; how two or three days ſometimes puts a period to their boaſting in particular Patients; brings a Cataſtrophe upon all their fair predictions; blaſts the deceitful hopes, they have lull'd the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and his Friends withal; and they live to prove themſelves falſe Diviners: And all becauſe they are too ſhort-witted to conſult the Oracles of Heaven, have not the right <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſtaff, to take the true alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Diſeaſe, nor what degrees it wants of the Horizon of Life; they are too ſhort-ſighted to view the Records of Heaven, and too inferior to know the Counſels of the moſt High; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is juſt with him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o baffle them in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and confute them in their predictions.</p>
                  <p>How uncertain are the predictions by Urines, which are as readily changeable as any liquid juyce in the body. It hath indeed moſt what the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent principles as the Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> a Phlegm, a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, volatile Spirit or Salt, and a Salt <hi>Marine,</hi> with ſome reſident <hi>Faeces;</hi> ſo that ſometimes the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Blood, is indicated thereby. For as from a due
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41152:116"/>proportionable mixture, of the conſtitutive Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thereof, the Sulphur well tempering and tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturing the volatile Salt in the Phlegm, gives that curious citrine colour to healthful Urines; yet are they not always ſound, becauſe ſo coloured, for we ſee that in any languiſhing Diſtempers, where ſome principal parts are much vitiated both in their native ferment, as alſo in the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> thereof, and yet the Urine keeps its natural colour: whence ſprings, as from one root, much deceitfulneſs in Urines, as to predict any thing of truth, as to the form of the Diſeaſe thereby; and any ſlight diſorder of the laſt paſſages it runs through, will eaſily pervert the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of all other primary parts, and this gives an other ground of miſtakes, in the judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Urines.</p>
                  <p>Some indications in ſome Diſeaſes, may be had from the Urine, but they are incondeſirable, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with thoſe, we either have from conference with the Patient, or the Patient's Meſſenger. The truth of it is, the World is ſo generally trained up, with the cuſtom of bringing their Waters, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a large Lecture of their Diſeaſe to be read thereon, which many Phyſicians make a ſhift to do, pumping with a few conſiderable previous Queries; Inſomuch that the People look not upon him as a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of skill, who cannot read to them the Diſeaſe out of the Water: which if he can do, though it be but from what he hath already gathered from them, by the by, yet he then paſſeth for a man of judgement, though he is wiſer than to think himſelf ſo upon that account.</p>
                  <p>Many People are ſo credulous, that they verily believe, he whom they repute a skilful Phyſician, doth certainly know the Diſeaſe and every punctilio thereof from the Water, and look upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41152:117"/>as Oracles from the Urinal, which they firmly believe he ſpeaks, from his depth of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, thus the People are willingly deceived. And ſome Phyſicians, of this opinion, <hi>Si Populus vult decipi, decipiatur,</hi> as the Learned Abbot, riding through a Country-Town, the vulgar People whom he paſſed by, deſired his Bleſſing, to whom he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very gravely, as if he had uttered a form of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, <hi>Si Populus vult decipi, decipiatur,</hi> ſtrech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his hands after a ſolemn manner; which they received very thankfully, and perhaps did them as much good, as his Bleſſing would.</p>
                  <p>The groſs miſtakes that ſome are apt to commit, either accidentally or deſignedly, might methinks ſtartle Phyſicians from being too poſitive in their predictions therefrom; as (for inſtance) a Maid miſtook the Vinegar-bottle for her Miſtreſſes water, carryed it very orderly to a Phyſician; who upon previous Queries gave his judgement very methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, upon her Miſtreſſes Infirmities: thus far all was pretty well, but the Maid returning, found her Miſtreſſes water in the Urinal, in the ſame Window ſhe had accidentally taken the Vinegar-bottle, away ſhe carryed it to the Doctor, told him her miſtake; but it's no matter, the Diſeaſes he ſaw in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-bottle, were ſomewhat alike with thoſe in the Urinal-glaſs, and therefore the judgement he paſſed upon the Vinegar-bottle, was, for ought I know, as skilfully done as that upon the water it ſelf: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more, for every ordinary Phyſician can make a ſhift, to diſcover ſome Maladies by the Patient's wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but to read a Lecture thereof out of a Vinegar-bottle, was indeed extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>But really, I could wiſh, Phyſicians were more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and would deal more fairly above board, that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41152:117"/>in time they might unhinge the World from of this accuſtomed folly they have been by conſent trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up in, that the people may no longer be nuzzled up in the expectation of a Phyſitians looking at the Phyſiognomy of Diſeaſes; or ſtaring them in the Faces, through the Glaſs of the Water, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward they may not look upon them as Oracles, to divine Life and Death therefrom.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, I could heartily wiſh, they would conſult, a more facil way of practice; ſuch as by the efficacy thereof might prove more delightful to themſelves, and more grateful to their Patients: which certainly cannot be better attempted, then by a ſerious Scrutiny into the natures of Concrets, into the ferments of the Blood, and humors, and Depravations thereof; alſo into the Sympathy and Antipathy of all medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal ingredients, how the Vital or Animal ſpirits ſtand in agreement, or diſſonance therewith. All which, and the reſt, neceſſary to be known by a Phyſician, and beſt illuſtrated and confirmed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable experiments, which are the onely ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory <hi>Criterions</hi> in all ſolid knowledge, the want of which makes Phyſicians too erratick, and inconſtant in their Judgments.</p>

                  <head>A probable way propounded for the improvement of Experimental Philoſophy.</head>
                  <p>TOwards a promoting an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Philoſophy (one large branch whereof would be this of Phyſick,) I think it would not be impertinent, yea perhaps neceſſary, to lay aſide all or moſt of our Books, excepting ſuch, as by ſome Judicious perſons, might be reputed faithful, in their communication of experiments.</p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:41152:118"/>
                  <p>For they are the fancies and conceits, that are found in books, which makes the Readers erre, by determining their Judgments to this, or the other apprehenſion, which before was unbyaſſed, and might as well be informed of the truth, through matter of experiment, as not; whereas commonly in books Men have learned nothing more then to erre, to which they are, by natural propenſity inclin'd, beſides to ſee what large Volumes a man turnes over, before he can reap even but a ſmall Harveſt, of ſatifactory knowledge; and that cheifly, becauſe few there are, who buſie themſelves to write, but they have ſome Novelty, either in Hiſtory, Theory, or Practice, to preſent the world with, yet they commonly do ſo wire-draw, and ſpin it out at length, with ſo many circumſtantial, and often impertinent notions, that they fill up a volum, with that that they might have compriſed in half a dozen pages: all the reſt are meer Flouriſhes, and Appendices, which being tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, few men will cumber their heads therewithal, and therefore in effect they ſignifie nothing.</p>
                  <p>Now to avoid all this, and to lay a groundwork for a more facile, unprejudiced underſtanding of things, whereby, at length, a ſolid body of natural Philoſophy might be raiſed up, I would propound to the Judicious, this following Method.</p>

                  <p>For many books are like the <hi>Indies,</hi> where there are indeed real treaſures, but you muſt dig very deep and run over a great deal of waſt barren ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can find it: ſo that in theſe ſearches into the rich Mines of books, a man had need carry his <hi>Virga Divinatoria, (viz.)</hi> his Penſil to point out the moſt choyce obſervables.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Clavis Philoſophica,</hi> (conſiſting of the moſt ſelect experiments compil'd together, with reference to the Author and page, where if any pleas'd they might readily view the Author's obſervations thereon) would ſpare the learned afterwards, abundance of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and toil; for it ſhould conſiſt of ſeveral Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums, to which a daily addition ſhould be made, either of experiments confirming and ſeconding, the firſt already ſet down; or of collateral experiments, or laſtly of ſuch new experiments, as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſucceed upon Marrying actives upon paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives.</p>
                  <p>To the ſupplying of which <hi>Clavis Philoſophica</hi> that it might be well fraught with ſerviceable experiments of all ſorts, there ſhould ſome large Laboratory
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41152:119"/>or Laboratories be erected, fill'd with all manner of furnaces, for all kinds of purpoſes, in which many ingenious perſons, with their under-operators, ſhould be imployed, to proſecute experiments of every kind, in Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals; who conſerring one with another and comparing each others trials, ſhould daily place them down in the <hi>Clavis,</hi> with much accuratenes in every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: and after that to epitomize the experiment: ſo that he, who liſt may read it at large in all its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, or view it in ſhort.</p>
                  <p>As an additional to which, ſome other perſons, whoſe <hi>genius</hi> bends that way, ſhould improve a large piece of ground conſiſting of many Acres, with all manner of Trees, Shrubs, Plants, Flowers, Fruits <hi>&amp;c.</hi> imploying skilful Gardiners to plant, tranſplant, and dreſs them, keeping them in good order; in which garden ſhould be Aviaries of ſeveral ſorts, for all manner of Birds, foraign and domeſtick; alſo ponds for all ſorts of Fiſh, Glaſs Bee-hives, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den houſes built at convenient diſtances, according to the beſt Architectonical Art, with all manner of glaſſes placed therein at proportionable diſtances, for reflections, refractions, and tranſmiſſions of <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and that for the improvement of dioptricks; alſo all manner of Dials, placed according to the ſeveral declinations of the Sun.</p>

                  <p>From all which, ſhould the moſt obſervables be collected, both from the ſundry graftings, and inoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, inarchings of one ſort of fruit into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whence are the great variety of fruits and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,

                  <p>Alſo, obſerving the great variety of Cattle, their Food, Diſeaſes and Cures, by Plants and the like: The manifold diſſections whereof, would not a little
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41152:120"/>inform Anatomiſts; alſo noting their remarkable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſſences inward and outward, the ſtony concretions ingendred in any of their parts; the tryal of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal uſe, of which parts, would very much add to the further inabling Phyſicians to cure Diſeaſes more readily; as that the blood of an He-Goat ſhould certainly cure a Pleuriſie, taken after ſuch a manner as <hi>Helmont</hi> preſcribes, which would be no ſmall encouragement to a further proſecuting experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this nature; ſeeing that ſo much blood of a Bull would ſtrangle the Patient.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe, I ſay, ſuch remarkable experiments ſhould be noted down in the <hi>Clavis,</hi> as might be thought meet by the ingenuous Overſeers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers; and that in one Copy at large, with all addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional circumſtances, very faithfully ſet down; in another more ſhort Epitome barely deſcribing the Eſſentials of the experiments.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Clavis,</hi> thus furniſhed, and well fraught with Experiments of all ſorts, would be as a Treaſury or Store-houſe; out of which afterwards (in tract of time) another Book ſhould be writ, of the body of Natural Philoſophy, Intituled <hi>Philoſophia Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis,</hi> which ſhould be wholly grounded upon the <hi>Clavis,</hi> and have all its obſervations, demonſtrable from experiments, therein contained: this Book of Natural Philoſophy, ſhould be the genuine reſult and product of that of the <hi>Clavis.</hi>

                              <p>We ſee the Chymiſts partly for vailing their Art from the ignorant, but chiefly for contracting the terms, have given forth a form of Characters, thereby expreſſing many terms and things of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe, in a ſhort but general Character, which is read indifferently, but underſtood the ſame in all or moſt Languages, every Country reading them in their own Dialect, yet apprehend the ſame thing; though ſome few words are of a large extent, and pronounc'd muchwhat alike in moſt Languages, as for inſtance, <hi>Elixir</hi> is originally an <hi>Arabick</hi> word, but is muchwhat expreſſed the ſame both amongſt the <hi>Greeks, Latins, French, Engliſh, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Amen,</hi> is a word that runs through ſeveral Languages, the ſame, without any, or with little variation.</p>

So if the terms of any Art or Science, more generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ'd by a particular Character, would not a little both facilitate the underſtanding thereof, but alſo make it of more general uſe for other People of different Languages; the want of which, debars many other Nations from the knowledge of ſeveral Sciences, and ingenuous Arts; for words writ at length, are a platform of things, the Interpreters of and to the mind, the ſame are Characters, but in a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious form, and yet as ſignificant of and to the mind (if not more) than written words.</p>
                              <p>The mind which receives the impreſſions of things is the ſame, and informs it ſelf of the Signature of things, after the ſame manner as to it ſelf; and that, whether in words (and thoſe whether varied accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all Languages of the World) in figures, in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41152:122"/>Characters, Hieroglyphicks, or the like; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Building of <hi>Babel,</hi> all Languages were as one. What the Character of that Language was, if written we do no know: but ſurely as the Language ſo the Character was but one upon the whole face of the Earth.</p>
                              <p>And though this primitive Language hath loſt its unity, by being involved in the Confuſion; and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Tongues; yet we ſee, that the humane mind, in the Apprehenſion of things, underſtands the ſame in all, the whole variety of Languages, yea and the various changes, of the different <hi>Idioms</hi> of each of thoſe Languages: Onely the manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them and making them ſignificant to others cauſeth the great difference, and that ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Tongues.</p>
                              <p>Now onely the Primitive Chriſtians, were again taught this Original Language in the School of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> when they were filled with the Spirit at the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Cloven Tongues; for it is ſaid they began to ſpeak with other Tongues, and every man heard them ſpeak in his own Language: <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Medes, Elamites, Meſopotamians,</hi> thoſe alſo in <hi>India, Cappadocia, Pontus, &amp; Aſia, Phrygians, Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philians, Aegyptians, Romans, Cretes, Arabians,</hi> and out of every Nation under Heaven; All which every man in his own Language, heard them ſpeak the wonderful Workes of God.</p>
                              <p>Here was the greateſt opening of the Univerſal I anguage of nature, that ever was ſince the Diviſion of tongues, at the Rearing of <hi>Babel:</hi> For they were all (it's ſaid) with one accord, in one Place, in one Houſe. Now it's very probable that for avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Confuſion, one did but ſpeak at once, when he had done then another <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But every man heard
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41152:122"/>them ſpeak in his own Language: So that it is more then probable, they ſpoke in ſuch an Univerſal Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as was Significant to all; and that the minds of the people of all Nations, were ſo opened, as they underſtood what was ſaid: Even as if it had been ſpoken in their own Language, much what like an Univerſal Character, which every one might read in his own Language; onely with this difference, that the tones of the Language of nature, was ſo opened at that time, in the mouths of the Apoſtles, as that they reached the minds of all people, in their ſeveral Languages.</p>
                              <p>Now if we would ſet our faces towards the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of real Phyſiological knowledge, we ſhould lay our heads together, to conſult a more facile, and general way, of underſtanding one another, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages, without that vaſt trouble of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the various Tongues themſelves: Which to do, is in our power as God has given us a Rational un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, whereby we may improve a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral way, in ſignifying our minds, and intentions one to another. But to ſpeak again the Original Language of nature, is beyond our power; and therefore we are to let that alone, until the time of the Reſtauration of all things.</p>
                              <p>In order therefore to the contriving of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Character, thoſe ingenious perſons, or fellows of Colledges, who are ſet a part for this purpoſe, having no other Study, or Imployment to divert or hinder them, To whom I would propound theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Queries: Firſt whether they (laying their heads together) could not (I ſay) conſult the beſt and moſt Extenſive Character, that might have no dependance, upon any particular manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, peculiar to any particular Country, leaſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41152:123"/>it ſhould ſeem too much byaſſ'd by that Language and ſo be ſomewhat eſtrang'd from the intended Univerſality; and thereby give cauſe to ſome people, to complain of Inequality and Injuſtice in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution thereof?</p>
                              <p>Secondly. Whether they ſhould not ſearch out ſo many Roots, or Radical Characters, as might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the moſt known and uſeful things in the world; as, <hi>Man, Book, Houſe, Stone, &amp;c.</hi> which ſhould be orderly placed down in a Vocabulary: Which Radical Characters, ſhould be writ prety fair, and large, for a Reaſon, I ſhall afterwards ſpeak of.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly. Whether theſe Characters ſhould not be ſo contrived, (as to their form) as that they might indicate to the mind, the things they repreſent; which (perhaps) might not better be done, then by making (where occaſion offers) the Character to Signatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the thing repreſented, thereby becoming a ſhort <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of the things underſtood: which kind of <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> (how much it is to be uſed and improved) is to be left to the judicious contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Students herein: For all <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> Emblems, Words <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether writ or expreſſed, are but Characters of intelligible things: Therefore thoſe of them which carry a Signature of the things repre ented, are the ſooneſt catcht hold of by the mind, and the eaſilyeſt apprehended; the reaſon is, becauſe of their approximation to the <hi>Identity</hi> which is in the <hi>Idea</hi> of the things underſtood.</p>
                              <p>Fourthly. Whether, for the better underſtanding this Univerſal Character, the Syntax or Coherence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, could better be expreſſed, than by points in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious places, and little daſhes or ſtrokes of different ſhapes, interwoven amongſt the Characters? Whence proceeds the reaſon of the fairneſs and largeneſs (I
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41152:123"/>hinted) the Character ſhould be <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Additional points, and daſhes, which repreſent the the <hi>Syntax</hi> of the Character, might alſo be diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough, though much leſs, than the Character it ſelf. For which purpoſe, ſome few General and pithy Rules ſhould be contrived for the inſtitution of the <hi>Syntax</hi> thereof, which ſhould be taught in all Languages for the education of Children therein, and that at the firſt, without any exceptions at all; becauſe the giving many exceptions to Children too ſoon, in learning of any Language, hath prov'd no ſmall <hi>Remora</hi> thereto, by burthening their Memories too ſoon, with Grammar-Rules.</p>
                              <p>Fifthly. What this univerſal Character ſhould be? whether to be fram'd according to any known Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter? Therefore whether the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Arabick</hi> Character would not be of moſt general uſe, in the Fabrick hereof? Or, whether ſome new invented Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, might not be of a more univerſal extent? In the compoſure of which (in my apprehenſion) it ſhould not be Alphabetical at all; and that for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, firſt, Becauſe there is no general concurrence of any of the Languages in an Alphabetical order, in as much as the denomination of the ſame thing, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages, begins with different letters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral Alphabets, Thus, that which we in <hi>Engliſh</hi> call a <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> call <hi>Templum,</hi> 
                                 <gap reason="foreign">
                                    <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                 </gap> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>French Egliſe,</hi> the Low-<hi>Dutch Kercke,</hi> the <hi>German Kirche,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard Ygleſia,</hi> the <hi>Italian Chieſa,</hi> the <hi>Portugal Ygroyla, &amp;c.</hi> Moſt of which begin with different Alphabetical Letters; ſo that it would be impoſſible to reconcile the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to particular Alphabets.</p>
                              <p>The other reaſon, Why the univerſal Character ſhould not be Alphabetical, is, becauſe it would not
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41152:124"/>otherwiſe, be a Character, but a Language; which is a thing quite different from what I aim at: not to mention the tediouſneſs of ſuch an Alphabetical Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; ſeeing it is only required to be writ, and not to be ſpoken.</p>
                              <p>Sixthly. Alſo whether this Character, may not be perform'd by the Ten numerical Figures, and the various tranſpoſition of them; which would give variety enough, for many thouſand words: for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Alphabet of ours, or any other Language, to conſiſt (as they do) of Twenty four Letters, there might out of the various tranſpoſition of thoſe Letters be fram'd (if need were) ten thouſand times ten thouſand other words, beſides thoſe we frequently uſe; and that without any interfeering or coincidence of words, whoſe great variety would, indeed, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite (not to ſay infinite) and puzzle the greateſt Arithmeticians in the World.</p>
                              <p>Now, if we did but conſider the great variety the number ſeven doth produce, by the various tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of its unites, would perhaps facilitate our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, how the various tranſpoſition of the <hi>Decade,</hi> might produce ſufficient variety, to ſignifie all things in the World.</p>
                              <p>In order to which, Let us conſider the ſeven Tones or Notes in Muſick, whether vocal or inſtrumental; it's all one, though they be numbred eight, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, they are but ſeven; and that becauſe two of them are found to be flat, and therefore make up but one Note. Theſe ſeven contain all the varieties of Tones in Muſick; for theſe in three Cliffs (<hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>F C</hi> and <hi>G</hi>) make up the whole Scale of Muſick, in as much as the Cliffs are but a repetition of the ſame Notes in different Keys, high or low: ſo that an <hi>Octave</hi> is but a <hi>Unite</hi> again, and therefore makes no alteration to the ſeven radical Notes.</p>
                              <pb n="227" facs="tcp:41152:124"/>
                              <p>Now ſuppoſe a <hi>Monochord,</hi> to be the Diameter of a Circle; That to be divided into ſeven parts, in the Semidiameter of which, one way is produc'd a <hi>Diateſſaron</hi> or fourth; the other Semidiameter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a <hi>Diapente</hi> or Fifth; which Fifth is again di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into a <hi>Ditone,</hi> or Third <hi>major,</hi> and a Third <hi>minor.</hi> From the beginning of the Diameter to the end of the leſſer Third, is a <hi>Hexachordon</hi> or Sixth: but from <hi>Uniſon,</hi> or the beginning of the ſuppoſed Diameter, to the end or <hi>Octave</hi> thereof, is made a <hi>Diapaſon</hi> or Eighth: all which are reckoned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, ſo they be not Seconds or Sevenths to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceeding Note in the order of the Scale.</p>
                              <p>So that all Tones, whether Concords or Diſcords, are wrap'd up in thoſe ſeven Notes, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by theſe almoſt Univerſal Characters, <hi>viz. Sol, La, Mi, Fa, &amp;c.</hi> or by a more facile way, of the firſt ſeven Alphabetical Letters: Which Notes, though in number but ſeven, yet (I ſay) the tranſpoſitions thereof are ſo various, as that all the Compoſed Pieces of Muſick, of Voyce or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the whole World, hath not yet fathomed the depth of them; yea, and though a Hundred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in Muſick, were ſet a part, to Compoſe all the variety they could in an Hundred Years, would ſtill find a <hi>plus ultra,</hi> and ſome varieties they never hit on before; ſo indefinite is this Septenary Number. For it is a complete number, comprehending both the Creation, as alſo the Reſt or Ceſſation from Creation; in it is contained the wreſtling Wheel of the properties of Nature, and the Syſteme of the Planetary Orbs, which are the bodies of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; the number of the Metals are therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed; alſo the number of the days of the Week, the Jubile and the Clymacterick are from it, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41152:125"/>into its ſelf: And Laſtly, All Harmony is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained; though the chief Concords therein are the <hi>Diateſſaron, Diapente,</hi> and <hi>Diapaſon;</hi> whence is the truth of that ſaying, <hi>Tria ſunt omnia,</hi> yet the whole Scale of Muſick is wrap'd up therein, as aforeſaid.</p>
                              <p>Now if the Septenary, give this great variety, how much more ſhall the <hi>Decade,</hi> or number Ten give by the various tranſpoſitions thereof? Which number was called by the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi>

                              <p>Seventhly. Whether Children ſhould not be train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the learning this Character from their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41152:125"/>For let the Character it ſelf be what the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers pleaſe, whether in Figures or other form'd Characters of Lines, circular or angular, as they ſhall agree; yet this, whatever it be, is to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all School-Maſters, to whom the inſtruction of Youth is committed, who are to teach them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day the ſignification of ſo many Characters as they find they are capable of; not burdening their memories with too many at a time, and thoſe, of things moſt familiar, and of greateſt uſe: ſo skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordering their Method in teaching them, as that it may beget a kind of delight and pleaſure in Children to read them.</p>
                              <p>And inſtead of asking them, What letter is that? to ask them What word is that? Which (in a while) by being accuſtomed thereto, they will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily anſwer (as they uſually do,) to the name of ſuch and ſuch a letter: ſo that in time theſe Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will eaſily be learnt, and take ſuch deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as they (in a while) will find a facile prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to read them without heſitation.</p>
                              <p>Now for the promoting the underſtanding of which, they ſhould neither learn to read, nor write any other Language whatſoever: not ſo much as their Mother Tongue. For, as to their own Language, we ſee, Children get it faſt enough, by hearing others talk to them: Where if we obſerve, we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Notable method, hinted to us, in Childrens beginning to ſpeak that Language, that is firſt taught them <hi>(viz.)</hi> That, though we ſpeak to them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Syntax</hi> and <hi>Connexure</hi> of our Language, yet they onely (at firſt) admit of Vocabulary words, and of thoſe Monoſyllables, the eaſieſt, laying hold of thoſe words where the moſt ſtreſs, and greateſt <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis</hi> of a ſentence appears, waving all Connective and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41152:126"/>Concomitant termes, which we call by the name of <hi>Adverbs, Prepoſitions, Conjunctions and Inteject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions;</hi> ſingling out the ſignificant words, without reſpect to <hi>Caſe, gender,</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> in <hi>Nouns:</hi> or <hi>Moode, Tenſe, Number or Perſon in Verbs.</hi> Which obſervation is no ſmall hint to a method, both in the teaching of this Univerſal Character, as alſo for a Compendious inſtruction, in the teaching of Latine, or any other Language. For firſt, as to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Character, it hints, that a bare Character is at firſt to be taught, without any variation, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whatever to the <hi>Syntax;</hi> or without the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any Rule whatſoever: Nakedly decipering the Characters of the moſt uſual words, and things, which moſt frequently occurr in a Vocabulary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving others of leſs uſe till afterwards. And when Children are grown up, and fraught with a plentiful knowledge of theſe Characters; then to teach them to write nothing elſe, and withal to give them a few Rules, how to underſtand the Connexion, and <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax</hi> thereof, which (as I hinted before) ſhould be by ſome Additional points, and ſmall daſhes Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly plac'd: So that all the <hi>Declenſions of Nouns in Caſe, Gender, Number, and Perſon,</hi> ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a great deal of Succinctneſs.</p>
                              <p>For in the Character it ſelf, there can be no <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion</hi> at all; onely it may by Additional Strokes, repreſent the differences of the <hi>Caſe, Gender, and Number, of Nouns.</hi> The <hi>Genders</hi> are to be but three, Maſculine, Feminine, Neuter. Here all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugations of Verbs</hi> and ſpecial Rules of <hi>Nouns</hi> are to be omitted; the <hi>Moods of Verbs</hi> to be but three, <hi>(viz.) Indicative</hi> which is the Verb it ſelf; the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative,</hi> and <hi>Infinitive,</hi> which ſhould be noted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly; and <hi>Tenſes</hi> to be but three, <hi>viz. Preſent,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41152:126"/>Preterperfect and Future Tenſe,</hi> Noted alſo with their diſtinct marks. The three <hi>Concords</hi> to be chiefly-noted; the <hi>Pronoune</hi> to be ſet down in a ſmaller Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; the <hi>Adverb, Conjunction, Prepoſition, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> to be marked with different pricks. And ſome few pithy Rules ſhould be given for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Character, which might be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in ſhort, without thoſe tedious <hi>Ambages</hi> of the multitude of Grammatical Rules, ordinarily given for the teaching <hi>Latine, Greek &amp;c.</hi> And as the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid obſervation gives a hint, as to the method of the Univerſal Character: ſo likewiſe is it as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious inſtruction, for the teaching the <hi>Latine,</hi> or any other Language, where the firſt thing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is a Vocabulary or Dictionary of moſt uſual words; with a great number of which Children, or others (that intend the Learning the Language) are firſt to be well fraught, keeping as many of them in their menory, as they can well bear, before any Grammatical Rules of Conſtruction be given.</p>
                              <p>Here I cannot but wonder, that the uſual tedious Methods of teaching the <hi>Latine</hi> and other Tongues, have keept footing ſo long in theſe Northern parts, without further improvements, by more Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious wayes: That we ſhould be Six, Eight, or Ten Years in the Schools, to learn the <hi>Latine,</hi> and after that perhaps 5 6 or 7 Years at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; at the end of which, many cannot manage a current diſcourſe in <hi>Latine.</hi> They can make an Extraordinary good peice of <hi>Latine,</hi> can adorn it with all the trops, figures, and floſcul's of Elegance imaginable: They can correct the leaſt miſtake in any <hi>Latine</hi> Author, they meet with; and yet, let them come to make a familiar diſcourſe in <hi>Latine</hi> (which is the nobleſt and moſt uſeful part thereof)
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41152:127"/>there they find themſelves at a loſs; and what they do upon theſe occaſions, is with ſuch a deal of force, and racking of their parts, as that, becauſe they do it not glibly, in a current Style, therefore (whilſt ingag'd in ſuch diſcourſes) they ſeeme to have no ſmall trouble upon them: Why, what's the Reaſon hereof? The main cauſe (as I apprehend) is this, that they are too much Grammatical: Attend more to Rules, then to a plenty of words, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine propriety of ſpeech, which to perform in a familiar Idiom, is certainly the moſt Noble and uſeful part of a Language, eſpecially for a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. For by beginning with, and dwelling long upon Grammar Rules, the true Method is inverted, as I ſhall ſhew afterwards.</p>
                              <p>The next Reaſon is, becauſe we here in <hi>England,</hi> do not (no not in the Univerſities themſelves) fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently manage familiar diſcourſe in <hi>Latine;</hi> which without doubt is one great <hi>Remora</hi> in the way to a current Glibneſs, in the utterance of any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: For we attain not to the knowledge of any Science, without a frequent accuſtoming, and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arizing our ſelves with the Maxims thereof; nor to any degree of perfection, in any Manual artifice, without reiterate attempts, whereby at length, we make it become Habitual, and in a manner natural to us: So that nothing ſooner begets a fluency in ſpeech, then frequent familiar diſcourſes therein.</p>
                              <p>The true Method of teaching the <hi>Latine,</hi> or other Languages in Schools, is moſtwhat inverted (as I ſaid) and that thus we uſually in Schooles begin to teach Children in the Accedence, and after that in Grammar Rules, onely learning them ſome few words by heart: and by this means, Children ſpend a long time in Learning the Rudiments of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41152:127"/>the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue; which Rudiments ſo long as we begin with them, are properly call'd Rudiments, but in reallity of a true method, they are not Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments: But rather a compleat treaſury of words in the memory: I ſhould much ſooner call them Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, and that becauſe they are firſt to be learnt. And therefore a true method, would indicate inſtead, of teaching Accedence and Grammar Rules, to begin onely with words, teaching Children every day ſo many words, and thoſe at firſt ſuch as are moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently us'd; and that without any toil of the maſter further then asking them (after he has taught them) what is <hi>Latine</hi> for ſuch a word, and what is <hi>Engliſh</hi> for ſuch a <hi>Latine</hi> word, and then making Children one to examin another, and to ſhew them the way of finding out the <hi>Latine</hi> for <hi>Engliſh</hi> words, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> for <hi>Latine</hi> words in Vocabularies, or Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries: And thus, by a kind of ſport, to bring them on till they have got a competent number of words; which words they ſhould alwayes be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as occaſion offers) one with another, though they know nothing at all as to the <hi>Syntax</hi> thereof; how to make them agree one with another: I ſay, a true method ſhould proceed after the aforeſaidmanner.</p>
                              <p>Now, That I call a true Method, which is hinted moſt what in the natural inſtinct of Children, in the learning their native tongue, or any Language they are firſt taught; but we ſee plainly, that Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with words, which are ſignificant to expreſs what they mean, or what they would have, though they know nothing at all of the <hi>Syntax</hi> of thoſe words, or of putting them into a form of ſpeech. Thus if a Child want Beer, he cryes beer (as wel as he can) which we underſtand as wel almoſt, as if he ſhould have ſaid, give me ſome beer; I want ſome
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41152:128"/>beer; pray help me to ſome beer: ſo, if he ſay, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or go Garden, we underſtand him, as wel as if he had ſaid, I would go into the Garden, or carry me into the Garden: though I ſay, the Child under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands nothing of the Connection, or Congruence of words; yet he minds the ſignificant words, while we in our minds make it into a ſentence, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand it as if he had ſpoken at large.</p>
                              <p>And although he onely ſingles out ſignificant ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple words, and knows no method of Congruence or applying them one to another, ſo as to make a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of them; yet is he never at all the further of from a right method of Learning that Language, but comes on forward, and Learns the <hi>Syntax,</hi> and congruence of words, amongſt themſelves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and that without any Rules, but familiarity of ſpeech, which in continuance of time, begets a current glib Language, ſo as he is able to expreſs himſelf (when he comes to that ripeneſs of years) readily at a pretty round rate, and that without the cumber of any Grammatical Rules: Which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the greateſt (if not the Sole) obſtacle of Learning a Language ſo as to ſpeak it fluently.</p>
                              <p>As this Method is hinted ſecretly (though to an obſerving eye openly enough) from the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of Children, in Learning the firſt Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage put to them: ſo in our inſtruction in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any other Language, as <hi>Latin,</hi> or the like, we ſhould in theſe ſecondary or artificial Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, attend the ſame Method, as is (I ſay) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Natural: And that to begin with words, and to lay by (for a time) all the ſuppoſed Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Accidence and Grammar, ſtocking the Memory of the Scholars only with words, which he may uſe to ſpeak to other Boys, as Children uſe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41152:128"/>their words to us, without any cognizance of the coherence of them; and that afterwards, when he comes to ſutable Years, its requiſite he ſhould know the <hi>Syutax</hi> of the Language, and then he ſhould have ſome few pithy Rules given him; but ſuch as ſhould not be writ in <hi>Latin,</hi> but in his own familiar Language. For it hath been no ſmall hinderance to Children, in their ready attaining to the knowledge of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, to have their Rules in <hi>Latin,</hi> and thoſe (many of them) frivolous and unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, burdening their Memories with impertinencies, which (while they are getting their Rules by heart, and before they can underſtand them) a great part of their time is ſpent, wherein they might (if proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, with a right Method) have arriv'd to a great degree of knowledge, in the expreſſing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpeaking of the Language. So that the Rules thereof, hath been no leſs tedious, and perhaps more than the Language it ſelf, if taught by a facile, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, genuine way.</p>
                              <p>For by right, the Maſter that teacheth <hi>Latin,</hi> or any other Language, ſhould (for the moſt part) ſpeak nothing elſe but that Language he teacheth, and ſhould ſuffer his Scholars to ſpeak nothing elſe to him, or to each other, but <hi>Latin;</hi> and that though they be only ſuch words, as whereby they can gueſs at each others meanings, as we gueſs at the meaning of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they in ſhort pronounce only a word (and that the moſt ſignificant one) for a ſentence: And thus they ſhould do, though they ſpeak falſe <hi>Latin</hi> very frequently; ſo as the Maſter ſpeaking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together or moſtwhat to them in <hi>Latin,</hi> will in time (and that not long if compared with that time which is ſpent in the common way) ſo familiarize the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to them, that they will need very few Rules.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41152:129"/>For by how much the more natural any Language becomes to us, the leſs cognizance we have of Grammar-Rules.</p>
                              <p>And therefore it is, that Children Twelve Years old in other Countries, ſhall, and do ſpeak <hi>Latin</hi> more familiarly and with abundance more facility, than we do at Twenty or above, though we have been train'd up in <hi>Latin</hi>-Schools, moſt of our young time. And all this proceeds from the wrong Method we take in the Learning the <hi>Latin,</hi> and that too chiefly from the puzzling intricacies of our <hi>Latin</hi> Grammars, which if we had never known, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the foreſaid Method, we had not loſt ſo much of our pretious time in hunting after that Language. For they in other Countries, by the uſe of Vocabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries and Dictionaries, together with the frequent cuſtom of ſpeaking the Language, become furniſhed with a great ſtock of ſignificant words, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compos'd by ſome few general Rules, inables them in a little time both to underſtand and ſpeak the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue very fluently.</p>
                              <p>Thus alſo the Univerſal-Character (we are ſpeaking of) ſhould be plac'd down in Vocabularies or Dictionaries, with the ſignification thereof in every particular Language, which ſhould be taught in all Schools, in every Nation, <hi>viz</hi> firſt to be read chiefly and particularly in the native Language of the place; and if any after the through underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in their own Language, ſhould be deſirous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may be taught to read it into <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> or what Tongue they pleaſe.</p>
                              <p>And for the making it Univerſal, it ſhould be ſo ordered, as that no other form of Writing be at all followed, not ſo much as to Write their own Native Language, any other wayes than by this Character,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41152:129"/>and that leaſt any other manner of Writing ſhould gain ground, and thereby cauſe a deficiency in the general Character; ſo that let a man learn as many Languages as he pleaſeth, yet if he would expreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in any of theſe Languages he ſhould do it by the Character, and by that he may as well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs what he hath of experiment or obſervation to communicate to the World, from his own native Language, as from any other whatever.</p>
                              <p>Alſo all Books of publick uſe, and of general inſtruction, ſhould be writ or tranſlated in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and Children ſhould be train'd up in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from their Child-hood. Thus (in a few years) the whole Sceen of Writings, I mean ſuch as are moſt proper for the uſe of Mankind, would be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd, and put into a new form of this Univerſal Character; ſo that one Nation may read the various Tranſactions, and rare Inventions of each other, in their own Language, without an Interpreter or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator of one Language into another, which would beget a community of correſpondence, even betwixt the remoteſt of Kingdomes.</p>
                              <p>And by the foreſaid Method, generally obſerv'd, and that by publick Edict of all Princes within their Dominions, Children and others, would make ſuch a proficiency in this new way of underſtanding each other by one ſimple Univerſal Character, as that the World, once in a Dozen or Twenty Years, would grow weary of writing their own Language, in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and words at length, and finding ſuch a facile ready way of writing by this Character, would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſe therewith, and willingly make it their ſole form of writing.</p>
                              <p>The benefit and profit of this Univerſal Character to Mankind, would be no leſs Univerſal than the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41152:130"/>Character it ſelf; for by this means, Princes might readily underſtand the Policies of forreign States, and if good, make them preſidents to themſelves: Philoſophers (hereby) might have a ready intelligence of the moſt remarkable occurrences and Philoſophick Tranſactions throughout the World, to the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of experimental Phyſiology.

                              <p>And (to conclude) all liberal Sciences, Ingenuous Arts, and thriving Manufactures, with Mechanical inventions, would receive no ſmall improvement by this way of communication, through the help of the Univerſal Character; and by obſervations in Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological Eſſays, from all parts abroad, the Structure of a body of true Genuine Philoſophy, might (in a little time) be raiſed, to the great uſe, and benefit of mankind in all ſorts of uſeful learning, both ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, and practick. So that (thereby) in a few

                  <p>THus would Phyſiology be advanced in every part and branch thereof, becoming more facile, certain, and grateful, by being grounded upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, then by any other conjectural <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> though as I ſaid, it is but <hi>Scientia naturalis à poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori,</hi> being as far (or more) ſhort of that intuitive knowledge which <hi>Adam</hi> had in Paradiſe, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural Hypotheſis is of it; yet is this very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe it joyns iſſue with our Senſes, whence we now, after a Prepoſterous manner, aſſume moſt of our knowledge of natural things.</p>
                  <p>A conſiderable part of this Book of <hi>Philoſophia Naturalis,</hi> would be ſpent in the Phyſical or Medical Science: By which we ſhould know, what concrets, how us'd, and by what means they become helpful for the reliefe of our infirm and diſeaſed Bodyes; in which that improvement made in the Laboratories by various preparations and trials thereof upon ſick perſons, would be of great importance.</p>
                  <p>And this brings me to the third and laſt thing, I propounded to my ſelf, to diſcourſe of, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the uſe and efficacy of Chymical remedies; I mean, how much more aſſiſtance nature hath by the help of Chymical Medicines in order to the cure of diſeaſes, then by the vulgar Shop-preparations; and here, me thinks, the Cabinets of natures rarities are opened and by this noble Art we are let into the grand Myſteries, and choyce Secrets of medicinal Preparations, which, being ſeperated from their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41152:131"/>terrene <hi>Faeces,</hi> and corrected from their annexed viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, penetrate into the very intimate receſſes and ſecret <hi>Meanders</hi> of the Body, helping nature at every turn, both to manifeſt what is uſeful by ſolution, inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and abſterſion of the peccant <hi>Sordes;</hi> as alſo by fortifying the vital powers and functions, and that corroboration; and reſtauration of the vital Principals.</p>
                  <p>No Ingenious Perſon, can longer ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in the common practice of the <hi>Galenical</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; when he once begins to reflect upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the Method, and unſuccesfulneſs of his Curing Diſeaſes; eſpecially when he comes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the reaſons thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the rawneſs, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of the diſpenſatory Preparations; the Farra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous mixtures whereof, render them leſs effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, then if they were more ſimple; and puts the young practitioner to a great loſs (whilſt the elder, (and therefore accounted the more experienced Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician) jogs on right or wrong, according to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical rules of Art) for when he expects, as wel for his credit ſake, as his deſire of doing good, ſome great Cures, he finds nothing conſiderable done.</p>
                  <p>And this gives cauſe to many Induſtrious ſearching Phyſitians, now of late, to begin to throw off this <hi>Galenical</hi> yoak, and fall to work themſelves, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome neat Preparations according to the Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Art, for their own practice; by the efficacy of which, they are encouraged to proceed further, to the Preparation of more noble <hi>Arcana:</hi> which they muſt do, whilſt they are young, other wiſe when they grow old, they either become too lazie, to begin to work, or too much ſettled upon their Lees; then they think themſelves to old, to enter into the Chmycal <hi>Matrix,</hi> to be born Philoſophers by the fire,</p>
                  <p>The Chymical Preparations have theſe following
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41152:131"/>advantages of the Shop-Medicines; firſt, they are commonly much leſs in bulk than the other are, and therefore they leſs offend the Patient in taking them. What nauſeating Potions are frequently preſcribed (not to ſay that they are in their taſte, inferiour to Horſe-Drenches) which are apt to make the ſtomachs of ſome, who have taken thereof, even at the ſight of the next Potion to Vomit; whereas a few drops of a Spagyrical Liquor, given in a proper Vehicle: or a Mineral Powder given in a few grains (which in ſome Preparations hath ſome taſte, in others none) operates effectually enough, according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Phyſician.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chymical Medicines (if rightly prepared) are leſs dangerous than the <hi>Galenical.</hi> I ſhall not here vindicate the confident boaſtings of ſome quacking Pretenders to Chymiſtry, who preſume to cure all Diſeaſes with ſome ſecret Powder, Oyl, or the like; which (when known) is but a meer trifle, and ſcarce worthy the name of a genuine Chymical Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and yet (forſooth) theſe Medicaſters boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (though you ſhall ſcarce hear it from any of their Patients) what great wonders they can do; vilifying all others that are more modeſt than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and yet are Poſſeſſors of more noble Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant, how the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> have deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſinuated into the Vulgar, the great danger (as I ſaid before) of Chymical Medicines, which hath been no ſmall <hi>Remora</hi> to the progreſs of Chymical Phyſicians; till their unwearied diligence hath, with time, moſtwhat worn off that apprehenſion of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and they now begin to obſerve by ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, the great efficacy, together with the ſafety of Spagyrical Remedies.</p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:41152:132"/>
                  <p>For where the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> in their Diſpenſatories, ends, there the Chymical Phyſician begins, both to correct what they have done, by making their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions more homogeneal; and to proceed further to what they have not done: witneſs the elaborate Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Animadverſions on the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Diſpenſatory, by the ingenious <hi>Swelfer;</hi> who undoubtedly doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect moſt demonſtrably the errors of the vulgar <hi>Galenical</hi> Preparations, ſhewing very evidently their incongruous and farraginous mixtures; and beſides adds other dexterous Preparations, both Vegetable, Animal and Mineral, which they have not. In whoſe Book of Animadverſions, with his <hi>Mantiſſa Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> and <hi>Appendix</hi> thereto, the Reader may view plainly (as in a glaſs) the errors of the received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the vulgar Practice of Phyſick.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Chymical Remedies are more purified and refined from their terrene feculencies, than the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical;</hi> for in Decoctions, Syrups, Conſerves, Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, <hi>Lohochs,</hi> and ſome other Shop-Preparations, there are but very ſmall ſeparations of the terreſtrial <hi>Faeces,</hi> little depurations made: as for Decoctions, either the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which commonly is water (perhaps with the addition of ſome Wine) is not proper for extracting the virtues of the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, or by too much boyling, they let the volatile (and therefore moſt effectual) parts flie away, ſo that the virtues of the Concretes, are not ſufficiently hereby extricated from their bodily <hi>Compage;</hi> nor by pounding Vegetables, to make Conſerves thereof, with the addition of Sugar; nor the like addition of Sugar to the juyces thereof, to make Syrups; nor the additions of ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> together, with Sugar and Honey for <hi>Lohochs</hi> and Electuaries; I ſay, None of theſe do ſuffer any conſiderable ſeparation, of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41152:132"/>pure from the impure: but the <hi>Sanguis, cruor &amp; ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> of Vegetables, the good and bad are all jumbled together; and therefore Noble <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>Pharmacopoeia, Error Scholarum fuit, ſuccos Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barum, cum ſuo Parenchymate, Fermento prius non ſubigere, antequam optimarum partium ſelectio ſit poſſibilis;</hi> Who (obſerving the frequent Preparations of Vegetables into Syrups, Conſerves, and the like, without any ſeparation of parts) tells us, That the error thereof, is for want of the knowledge of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, and thereby of due ſeparations of the pure from the impure; and therefore alſo he ſaith (in another place to the ſame purpoſe) <hi>Diſcant Tyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſanguinem à cruore &amp; parenchymate plantarum diſtinguere, &amp; ſeparare, ſi quicquam laude dignum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſſe per ſimplicia meditentur:</hi> ſo that, unleſs there be ſome peculiar ſeparations of earthly feculencies, and other impurities (which muſt be done by previous Fermentations in the Preparations of Vegetables) we can ſcarce reap the Eſſential virtues thereof. Now in Syrups, Conſerves, Electuaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there are made no previous Fermentations, or putrefactions; and ſo conſequently no ſeparations of pure from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, <hi>Abſque reſeratione clauſarum virium five vitae radice, ac participatione, emendatione defectuum, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatum, excrementorum, &amp; poteſtatum violenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed Syrups and Conſerves, do by keeping, work and ferment; as we ſee that Syrups (whilſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) being cloſe ſhut up in glaſs-bottles, frequently break them, though never ſo ſtrong; Conſerves eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if made with powder'd Sugar, and kept one or two years (not with Loaf-Sugar which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly boyl'd up, with a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of <hi>Calx vive</hi>) do Ferment, whereby the <hi>Compage</hi> of the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41152:133"/>becomes opened, out of which (by a ſlight ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice) I ſometimes prepare a curious Spirit, as of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or Roſemary Flowers, which retains the taſte and virtue of the <hi>Species,</hi> whence they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chymical Remedies are frequently more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in their operation than the <hi>Galenical.</hi> By Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Medicines, I do not mean ſuch, as every ordinary bragging Chymiſt expoſeth to Sale, who themſelves are (through their vain empty boaſts) no otherwiſe than a reproach to the noble Art of Chymiſtry; and their Preparations ſpurious, in compariſon to the genuine products of the <hi>Spagyrical</hi> Art: but ſuch I call Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Medicines (whoſe efficacy I am treating of) as are made by a skilful Artiſt, who by continued experience, knows how to correct things corrigible; and how, by every ſucceeding Preparation, to further inrich his Medicines, with more noble virtues, by making exquiſite depurations and gradual ſeperations. Theſe will therefore more readily penetrate <hi>in inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos naturae thalamos,</hi> into the more inward receſſes of the Digeſtions, and Fabrick of the vital and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits; and thereby become more capable of rectifying the enormities of thoſe nimble Agents, who ſit at the ſtern of the Digeſtions, and govern the vital and animal functions, much more than thoſe clogging Medicines of Syrups, Conſerves, Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Lohochs,</hi> Potions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which commonly are either rejected as nauſeating to the Digeſtions; or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed off by ſeidge as cumberſom, by reaſon of the unſeparated Heterogeneities; or elſe ſtuff and clog the veſſels, cauſing obſtructions, and thence enormous Flatulencies.</p>

                  <head>Concerning the conſtitutive Principles of all Coneretes, whether Vegitable, Animal, or Mineral.</head>
                  <p>BEſides all which, the Preparation of Chymical Medicines, gives a diligent Searcher much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the Principles of Natural Philoſophy; which firſt inſinuated the <hi>Tria prima</hi> of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <hi>viz. Sal, Sulphur, &amp; Mercurius,</hi> to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all things; and that becauſe they found in the <hi>Analyſis</hi> of Bodies by the fire, that they were reducible to ſome, or all of thoſe three: for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Metals and Minerals to their firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as they ſuppos'd, they found by this Art, that they were ſeparable into a Sulphur or Oyl, which was the <hi>Hematina Metallorum,</hi> retaining the true tincture of the Metal; and into a Mercury, which in the Mineral Kingdom is current Quickſilver; and the key to this ſeparation they found to be in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Salt, which alſo needed reduction by Art, to its primitive ſimplicity and graduation to its greateſt activity.</p>
                  <p>They find alſo that Vegetables and Animals were, by the Pyrotecnical Art ſeparable into a Sulphur, <hi>viz.</hi> into an Oyl, or in Vegetables (by Fermentation) into a vinous Spirit; which is the ſame thing with an Eſſential Oyl, ſaving the different determination it receives from Fermentation: alſo into a Salt, and that either fixt or volatile; for in the Concrete they are the ſame, owing their difference to no other than to the force of fire; and laſtly, into a Mercury, which is their Phlegm, or watery parts, ſeparable by fire, or otherwiſe, by the exiccating <hi>Blaſs</hi> of the Air.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome of our modern Chymical Philoſophers (as the ingenious Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>) multiply theſe three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41152:134"/>five Principles, which in effect are but the three firſt ſtill; the five, which he reckons Bodies, are moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſeparable into rare Spirit, Oyl, Salt, Water and Earth; if by Spirit he means the vinous, got by Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, What difference is there, for both are Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, both take flame and burn alike, only the one is made by Fermentation, the other not; and being they have both the ſame Eſſential properties of Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mability, What ſhould hinder them from being Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs? But if he mean by Spirit, the volatile ſaline Spirit, which is not combuſtible: This volatile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by frequent rectification, may be brought into the form of a volatile Salt, whoſe Vehicle was water, Phlegm or Mercury; but the body of volatile Salt is Salt and therefore ſhould not be accounted as another Principle. As for that Principle which he calls Earth, if a Concrete may be volatiz'd and brought over the helm, without any reſident <hi>Caput mort,</hi> as the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical <hi>Adepti</hi> can perform, Then (I pray) what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his fixt Principles, he calls Earth? So that in the concluſion, we ſhall find his five to be reducible into the firſt three.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three Principles of <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> into which many Concretes are reducible, by the <hi>Analyſis</hi> of the fire, are again reducible into two, and thoſe are <hi>Aqua &amp; Semen,</hi> Water and Seed; which are the primitive conſtituent Principles of all Bodies in the <hi>Mundane Syſteme,</hi> to which two, the <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> are but poſteriour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, or offsprings of that double Original: Yea, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever parts, or ſuppoſed ſimple Principles, any ſort of Bodies are reducible into, they are but the ſequels or after-products (variouſly extorted by force of fire) of thoſe two real Principles, Water and Seed.</p>
                  <p>Water we ſuppoſe (and perhaps may prove) to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41152:134"/>be the firſt matter of all viſible Bodies. It is the true ſubject matter of all Concretes, which we thus prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That is the firſt material Principle of all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, into which they are ultimately, by a natural or artificial <hi>Analyſis</hi> reducible; but all Bodies are ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, by a natural or artificial <hi>Analyſis</hi> reducible into Water; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Water is the firſt material Principle of all Bodies. The <hi>Major</hi> is plain, and granted on all hands; for the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> (who plac'd the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all things, to be in the quaternary of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) did it, becauſe they ſuppos'd (but could not prove) that all Bodies were reducible into thoſe four Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> of Fire, Air, Water and Farth: ſo in like manner the Hermetical Philoſophers, in their weaving all Concretes, out of their <hi>Tria prima</hi> of <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> did ſuppoſe them to be the firſt Principles; becauſe many Bodies by the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the fire, were reducible into ſome what analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous thereto. And ſo thoſe who encreaſe thoſe three into five Principles, do it becauſe ſome Concretes are reſolvable by fire into thoſe five diſtinguiſhable parts; which indeed are rather new products of the fire, than genuine reſolutions into their firſt Principles.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> thereof reſts to be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Bodies are ultimately reducible into Water, by Art or Nature. That it may be done by Art, I ſhall demonſtrate from an infallible Experiment of the moſt profound Chymical Philoſopher, <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> who in his Tractate, Entituled <hi>Elementa,</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Noſtra Mechanica mihi patefecit, omne corpus (puta ſaxum) Lapidem, Gemmam, Silicem, Arenam, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſitam, &amp;c. tranſmutari in Salem actualem, aequi ponderantem ſuo corpori; unde factus eſt; &amp; quòd iſte Sal aliquoties, cohobatus, cum Sale circulato</hi> Paracelſi, <hi>ſuam omnino fixitatem amittat, tandem tranſmute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41152:135"/>in liquorem, qui etiam tandem in aquam inſipidam tranſit: &amp; quòd iſta aqua aequiponderet, Sali ſuo, unde manavit, viz.</hi> That by his liquor <hi>Alkaheſt</hi> (for ſo I underſtand his words <hi>Mechanica noſtra</hi>) every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whether Stones, Gems, Flints, Sand, Marcaſites, Earth, Brick, Glaſs, <hi>Calx,</hi> Sulphur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might be tranſmuted into an actual Salt, of the ſame weight with the body it was derived from, or was made from; and that Salt being cohobated ſometimes with <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> his <hi>Sal cironlatum,</hi> would loſe all its fixity, and be tranſmuted into a liquor, which at length would be turned into an inſipid water, of equal weight with the Salt whence it came.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith further, <hi>Plantam, carnes, oſſa, piſces &amp; quicquid ſimilium eſt, novi redigere in mera ſua Tria, unde poſtmodum aquam inſipidam confeci; motallum autem preptor ſui ſeminis anaticam commiſtionem, et arena (quellem) difficilimè in ſalem reducuntur; vix.</hi> by the ſame grand Solvent liquor, he knew how to reduce any plant, Fleſh, Bones, Fiſh, and the like into their three firſt Principles, which alſo were further reducible, yea actually (by him) reduc'd into an inſipid water: but the reduction of a Metal was difficult, by reaſon of the equal mixture of its Seed, and ſo alſo of the reduction of Sand.</p>
                  <p>Further he ſaith; <hi>Terrae originalis ſive arma, tam arti quâm naturae reſiſtat, nec queat ullis adminiculis a primaeva ſui conſtantiâ recedere (unico duntaxat Gr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heunae drtificialis igni excepto,) quo arena ſal fit, ac tandem aqua; quia vim habet agendi ſuper ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria quaevis abſ<expan>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41152:135"/>name of <hi>Gehenna:</hi> by which Sand, is made Salt, and at length converted into water, becauſe this ſolvent hath power to act upon all ſublunary bodies, and that without any reaction of bodies upon it.</p>
                  <p>By all which, we may ſee, that all bodies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, are by art ſo tranſmutable, as that at length they may be reduced into their ſimple Element of water; which if it were not their firſt material Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipic, they could not ultimately be reſolv'd thereinto; for both Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals, are by the natural <hi>Analyſis</hi> of the <hi>alkaheſt,</hi> at laſt redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible into common water. Concerning Vegetables he ſaith, <hi>novi aquam, cujus medio omnia vegetabilia in ſuccum diſtillabilem ſine ullâ ſui in fundo vitri reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia commutantur, qui ſuccus adjuncto alkali totus in aquam tranſit inſipidam.</hi> This is perform'd by the ſame Solvent liquor as the other was; ſo that Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables by the powerful operation of this liquor are changed into a diſtillable Juyce, which will paſs over the helm, without any <hi>Faeces or Caput mort</hi> left behind: which diſtilled Juyce being re-diſtilled from <hi>Alkalies,</hi> becomes totally reduced into a ſimple Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental water.</p>
                  <p>As to Animals, he ſaith, he reduc'd Fleſh, Bones, Fiſh and the like into an inſipid water; and as to Minerals or Metals the ſame is done, though with more difficulty. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> tells us that his <hi>Circulatum majus,</hi> which he alſo calls <hi>acetum acerri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum metallicum, &amp; primum ens liquidum Mercurii,</hi> if digeſted upon any of the Metals, doth reduce them to any oyl, or ſupernatant fat, tinctured accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the property of the Metal; by which, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are deducable into a magiſtery.

                  <p>For as it is in this, ſo alſo is it in other reductions,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:41152:136"/>by the ſame ſolvent; What becomes of the Salt, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Spirit, and earth? If theſe were real Principles, they would not be convertible one into another; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they be reducible into ſomething more ſimple then themſelves: in as much, as it is eſſential for Principles to be Primary, and to be the laſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. What becomes of the Spirit, one of the Principals of the Moderne Chymical Philoſophers? which whether it be Vinous, got by Fermentation; or Saline, got by diſtillation, yet is it really conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible into Salt: witneſs the <hi>Offa</hi> from Spirit of Wine, and Spirit of Urine; the <hi>Sal Alkali</hi> made out of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine which before was Flagrable, but being chang'd into a Salt hath loſt that; and laſtly the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Volatile Urinous Spirits, whether of plants or Animals, until they diſtil or Coagulate into the very body of Salt.</p>
                  <p>What becomes of Sulphur, or Oyl another ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Principle; for Sulphurs are convertible into Salts, as I have ſeen in an experimental proceſs, too redious here to be related; and <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith <hi>Salia aromatum ex eorum oleis facta, primi entis illorum vices ſubeunt;</hi> and that Oyl of Cinnamon if united to its own <hi>Alkali,</hi> by an artificial and ſecret circulation for the ſpace of three months, without any water, wil be totally changed into a volatile Salt.</p>
                  <p>Alſo what becomes of Salt, another main Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of both antient, and Modern Chymiſts? For whether it be fixt, or Volatile, neither of them is an ultimate, and ſo conſequently no primary Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in the concrete it is neither volatile, nor fixt, but made ſo by Fermentations or force of Fire; for in all ſimple diſtillations of Vegetables, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious putrefaction, there alwaies remains an <hi>Alkali</hi> or Salt, beſides the Volatile Salt which ariſeth by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41152:137"/>So in the actual Flagration or Calcination of Vegetables, the Salt catcheth hold of the Sulphur, and both become fixt together into an <hi>Alkali;</hi> which Aſſertion <hi>viz.</hi> that part of the Sulphur in the actual force of the Fire, is fixt with the Salt into an <hi>Alkali</hi> is apparent from the Saponarineſs of every <hi>Alkali,</hi> whether of Tartar or any dried Vegetable.</p>
                  <p>So that Salts, as they lie woven up with the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, in the Texture of the Concrete, are (as I ſaid,) neither fixt, nor volatile; but in the mutual imbraces of each other, become pregnant with the Medicinal Vertues, Odours, Sapours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Plant: and from different operations of fire, and ferments thereon, doth proceed both the Volatility and fixity of the Salt, their mutability of one into another, and Separation each from other.</p>
                  <p>Now both theſe are ultimately reducible into Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, or water, (which I look upon as <hi>Synonyma;</hi> for <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omze oleum diſtillatum, in ſalem eſt mutabile, &amp; in aquam per adjuncta;</hi> ſo that, into neither of them are bodies, by a genuine <hi>Analyſis,</hi> ultimately reducible, and therefore they are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Principles of things.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, what will become of earth, that firſt Principle of the Modern Chymiſts, and fourth of the <hi>Ariſtotelians?</hi> And although thoſe who contend for five Principles, becauſe Vegetables and Animals, are by a common <hi>Analyſis</hi> of the fire, ſeparable into ſo many diſtinguiſhable parts <hi>viz.</hi> an Oyl, Spirit, Salt, Phlegm, and Earth (I ſay) though they do find, after the ſeparation of the firſt four, an other part, as a feculent droſs of all the reſt, which they call earth; yet do we deny the Separation of theſe parts from a concret by force of fire, to be any true <hi>Analyſis,</hi> or proper way of taking bodies in pieces.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:41152:137"/>And therefore it is no genuine reduction thereof, into their primary Principles; but onely a forcing the parts aſunder, by violence of fire: ſo that, being put upon the Rack, if they make any confeſſion of their firſt parents, its onely extorſive. Alſo the <hi>baſis</hi> of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's</hi> Elements falls, <hi>imo ruit totum quaternarium ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum, praeter aquam;</hi> for if we ſtrictly examine what earth is, we ſhall find, that it enters not the compoſition of any body as a primary conſtitutive Ingredient thereof: and that, becauſe if we ſearch into the great variety of Earths, we may obſerve them all to be but fruits, or products of the primitive Principle <hi>(Water;)</hi> except hence that <hi>Arena (Quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, terra virginalis)</hi> which never enters into the compoſition of any body, <hi>quoad generatonem;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed artificially it enters the compoſition of Glaſs, of Brick, cement <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that is <hi>ſine ſemine praevio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the ſeveral ſorts of Earth, are various coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations of water, according to the difference of the Fracedinous ſeeds, diſperſed, and implanted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and that they are no leſs products of water, then Mineral Salts, middle Minerals, Stones, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Bodies are, all which receive a Specifical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination from the difference of the Fermental Seeds, Is (I ſay demonſtable by granting the veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Helmont's</hi> experiment aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> that all theſe Earths, Stones, Marcaſites, Minerals <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ultimately reducible into water, by his grand Solvent, the <hi>Alkaheſt;</hi> and that without any reſidence or <hi>Faeces</hi> at all: ſo that, if earth were a permanent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, it would be ſo as long as bodies are bodies and would alwayes remain earth after the reduction of the concrete into Elements.</p>
                  <p>As earth is no Element, ſo neither doth air enter, as ſuch, into the compoſition of Bodies; and though
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41152:138"/>its true, that air is both uſeful, and neceſſary for Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation, and Animation, without which neither do plants grow, nor Animals live: yet is it onely <hi>reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculum vitae,</hi> promoting in Animals, both circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and volatization of the Blood, and helps every part to perform the motion proper thereunto, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we cannot go to ſtoole without the help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, compreſſing the muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and ſo of Urine, and the like; but ſtill it enters not the compoſition of any body, as an Elementary Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient thereof. Nor is any body ultimately reſolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereinto; for though there be a <hi>flatus</hi> ariſing uſually from the Enormities of the digeſtions, yet that is quite another thing then air.</p>
                  <p>And as neither earth nor air, ſo neither fire enters the compoſition of any concrete; for though there be heat, and conſequently a kind of fire, in the body of Animals: yet that is no other than a product of Vital Fermentation, and no radical Principle; and therefore <hi>Paracelſus</hi> was to be laughed at, who in his Tractate <hi>De ſeparatione Elementorum,</hi> teacheth the ſeparation of the Element of fire, and out of it again a new ſeparation of Elements. For if I ſhould, with him, ſuppoſe an Element of fire; yet if that be further reducible, it forthwith looſeth both the name and nature of an Element: and although he, and other <hi>Hermetical Philoſophers,</hi> tell us of the ſeparation of <hi>Elementum iguis de vitriolo Veneris,</hi> yet by that we muſt onely underſtand, the <hi>Sulphur</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Vitriol of Copper, which <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Antimony &amp;c.</hi> they call fires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they have a power of maturating, and digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mercurial Crudities, into a penetrative ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Elixir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, that neither the Ternary of Principles,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41152:138"/>of <hi>Hermetical</hi> Philoſophers, nor the quaternary of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> nor yet quinary of the Modern Philoſophers, are ſufficient to be accounted real ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Principles, into which all Concretes ſhould ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately be reducible; becauſe they themſelves are yet remigrable into a more ſimple Element: and therefore <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> forfeit the Prerogative of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Principles.</p>

                  <p>Now as by the higheſt Preparation in the Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Art, Concretes become reducible into water; ſo likewiſe we ſee in a natural circulation, out of one ſhape into another, that water is found moſt what to be the laſt: For all Vegetables are diſtillable into a great proportion of water, alſo all juyces of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, are by Fermentation brought into potable Liquors, and thoſe again into Vinegar, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a vapid Liquor, which at length is nothing but ſimple water. The Vine we ſee, which is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt of Vegetables, according to the nature of its
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41152:139"/>Seed, ſpecificates the water or <hi>Succus (leffas) Terrae</hi> into its own ſhape, attracting like a <hi>Syphon</hi> the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Water in great plenty, out of the Earth, into its leaves and cluſters. This innate Seed which makes the difference of water, coagulated in this Vegetable, from that coagulated in other Vegetables, by the concurrence of the influence of the Sun, and Seaſon of the Year, begets a Salt and a Sulphur; theſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually acting upon each other in the Mercurial part, beget a Fermentation; in which Fermentation, there happens a ſeparation and rejection of a feculent part, to the ſides of the veſſels, which is called <hi>Tartar,</hi> from which <hi>Tartar,</hi> by force of fire, is ſeparable a Sulphur, Salt, Mercury, Spirit and feculent Earth; all which are not really pre-exiſtent in the <hi>Tartar,</hi> but are new products by the fire, whereof the Salt and Empyreumatick Sulphur digeſted together, do by Diſtillation give a water; and the Spirit at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into water.</p>
                  <p>Now by Fermentation, and while the feculent <hi>Tartar</hi> is ſeparating the Sulphur, by working upon the Salt, become united, and ſo graduated as they both combine in the Fabrick of a vinous combuſtible Spirit, which is promoted by a ſecret Fermentation, after the actual working is over; which is nothing elſe but a more firm and cloſely riveted union of the Sulphur and Salt, maturating the Mercurial part into a generous Wine.</p>
                  <p>This Wine, either diſtill'd, is the moſt part of it left, as an inſipid Phlegm or water; yea and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flammable vinous Spirit, is by the touch of Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> in Fifteen or Sixteen parts thereof (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Helmont</hi>) reducible into ſimple water: or if the Salt thereof become too much exalted, by letting go its Sulphur, then it degenerates into Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41152:140"/>which Vinegar (if dulcified by making <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charum Saturni,</hi> or the <hi>Sal Sennerti</hi>) is totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible into an inſipid water. The like happens in all Vegetables, for Water is the material Principle of Vegetables; and therefore they ultimately reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable thereinto.</p>
                  <p>That Water is the material Principle of Vegetables, is apparent, both becauſe without water, whether diſtilled down upon the earth, in the circulation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in Dews or Rain; or by the overflowing of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers upon the grounds, whence the fertility of <hi>Aegypt</hi> from <hi>Nilus</hi> his overflowing the banks; or by any other ſort of watering grounds, becauſe (I ſay) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water, from ſome of the foreſaid ways, neither do Plants take nor increaſe, nor is any Vegetation perform'd: alſo becauſe in water many Vegetables grow, ſhoot forth roots, and ſpread very largely, witneſs Mint, and ſeveral other Plants, whoſe tops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only nipt off, and put into a glaſs-viol, full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they begin in a few days, as I have ſeen, to ſhoot forth ſpriggy roots; and from thence to grow up to a great height, even as if they were actually planted or ſet in earth; whoſe growth and increaſe is from nothing elſe but ſimple water. So alſo many Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables (as I ſaid) grow in water, and have no roots at all faſtened in the earth.</p>
                  <p>To confirm which further, that remarkable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of <hi>Helmont</hi> is very conſiderable, <hi>viz.</hi> He planted the Trunk of a Willow Tree, of five pound weight, in Two hundred pound of earth dried in an Oven: having put them in earthen veſſel, he moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened it with Rain-water; after five years the Tree weighed One Hundred Sixty nine pound, three Ounces: and the earth being dried was of the ſame weight as at firſt. Now, Whence ſhould proceed the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41152:140"/>great addition of weight to the Tree, of no leſs than One Hundred Sixty four pounds, unleſs from water, than which it had no other additional? The wood of which Tree I ſuppoſe no man will deny to be different from any other wood of the ſame <hi>ſpecies;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon Diſtillation muſt yield a ſowre Spirit, an Oyl, Phlegm, and Salt; if burnt and ſeparated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſoot and aſhes, that ſoot again would yield a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt, Oyl, Spirit, Phlegm and Earth: all which are but the products of water, as by the Experiment is demonſtrable.</p>
                  <p>To the like purpoſe the moſt ingenuous <hi>Robers Boyl</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> hath an Experiment which was thus. In a weighed quantity of digged earth, baked in an Oven, and put into an earthen pot, he ſet the ſeed of a Squaſh; this he ordered to be watered only, with Rain or Spring-water, I did not (ſaith he) without much delight behold how faſt it grew, though unſeaſonably ſown, which was about the middle of <hi>May;</hi> the haſtening Winter hindred it from coming to its wonted magnitude: About the middle of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> it was taken up, whoſe weight, with the ſtalk and leaves, was two Pound twelve ounces; the earth he baked as formerly, and found it the ſame weight. The like Experiment he had of Cucumbers, he had two fair ones, the weight of which were ten pounds and an half; the branches with the roots weighed three pounds, fourteen ounces: then baking the earth twice, and its weight was decreaſed one pound and an half; which twice baking might ſomewhat minorate the weight of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Now, Whence ſhould proceed that great bulk, both in the Squaſh and Cucumbers, unleſs from water, which was the only matter additional thereto? And what happens to theſe planted in earth, and fed with
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41152:141"/>water, whoſe increaſe is found to be ſimply from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, The ſame (I ſay) doth, more than probably, happen to all other Vegetables, ſpringing up from their innate Seeds, or tranſplanted into other Soyls; and that the Earth is only a receptacle or <hi>Matrix,</hi> where the variety of Seeds conceive in the common Mercury, Water (or <hi>Leffas Terrae</hi>) and bring forth a Salt and Sulphur, from whoſe acting one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſource of corruption, ariſeth the Vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in that the formation of the Plant, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Idea</hi> wrapt up in the boſom of the Seed: for theſe two active ſecondary Principles, being hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out from the ſeminal <hi>Archeus,</hi> work themſelves extenſively downward, but chiefly upwards, cloath themſelves with a body from the primary Element of Water, and ſhoot forth into ſtalks, leaves, flowers, fruits, ſeeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhapes the body according to the platform of the ſeminal <hi>Idea,</hi> extraverteth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties thereof, whence the variety of colours, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, ſapours and other ſpecifical qualities, flowing from the eſſence thereof, better known to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Archeus,</hi> by aſſiſting it againſt many Diſeaſes, than apparent to the reaſon of man.</p>
                  <p>As we have demonſtrated Vegetables to have their original material Principles from water, ſo alſo Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals have water for their conſtitutive Element.</p>
                  <p>For all Animals (I mean <hi>ſuperterreſtrial</hi>) have their nouriſhment, either immediately or mediately from Vegetables and Water; immediately as all manner of Cattle, proper for the food of Man; mediately as Man, who feeds upon the fleſh of Beaſts, and ſometimes immediately upon Herbs themſelves: ſo that in Beaſts that feed of Graſs and Corn, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becomes once more remov'd from its primitive ſimplicity, undergoes a further tranſmutation by an
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41152:141"/>Animal Ferment, that whereas before it had received a ſimple tranſmutation, or coagulation into plants and fruits of the earth, it now (by Beaſts feeding thereon) ſuffers a ſecond alteration; and by the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Animal, is turn'd into a <hi>Chyle, Chyme,</hi> Milk, Blood, Urine, Fleſh, Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all theſe different one from another, according to the difference of the <hi>Species.</hi>

                  <p>Now theſe Creatures, or parts thereof, are further tranſmutable by the Ferment of other Animals that feed upon them; as for inſtance, the fleſh of Beaſts, or milk therefrom (which is water twice remov'd by the <hi>Medium</hi> of Ferments) is by the Ferment of an humane ſtomach, altered again into a <hi>Chyle, Chyme,</hi> Milk, Blood, Fleſh, Bones, Urines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the ſpecifical Salt and Sulphur, do act variou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly upon each other; which in ſound perſons by the aſſiſtance of the Ferment of the heart, work each other into a ruby balſamick Animal <hi>Elixir:</hi> and that coagulated in the capillary veſſels, becomes Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>And we ſee, if Blood be diſtill'd, the greateſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof is Phlegm or Water, ſo that, above two thirds thereof is an Elementary water; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Urine is moſt part of it ſeparable into a wateriſh Phlegm; and Milk diſtill'd ariſeth, the moſt of it, in an inſipid water: in the diſtillation of the fleſh of an Animal, a great part thereof ariſeth into water; amongſt which the fleſh of Eeles, if diſtill'd (as that great Naturaliſt Squire <hi>Boyle</hi> witneſſeth) yield a very great proportion of water, in which (while diſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) they ſeem to boyl as in a pot of water, or like <hi>Dantz</hi> Vitriol in an earthen pot, placed in the fire, ſeemed to be nothing elſe but water, ſo theſe to be nothing elſe but Phlegm coneal'd.</p>

And that Seed together with the potential Ferments thereof, are the Authors of all tranſmutations; by the operation of which, Water becomes differently coagulated and ſpecificated, according to the variety of the Seed, and the innate Ferments thereof, into this or the other formal Concrete or part thereof: which Ferments being connatural with the Seed, is more powerful than fire, and therefore fitter Agents for tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than fire; and that becauſe, fire can only burn Stones into a <hi>Calx</hi> (as the moſt profound Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith) and wood or Vegetables are thereby turned into aſhes, than which (unleſs by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Sand, it may further make glaſs) the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary fire can operate no further, and yet theſe very <hi>Calx</hi>-ſtones and aſhes, may, by a Ferment in the earth, be tranſmuted into the <hi>Succus</hi> (or <hi>Leffas</hi>) <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae;</hi> and thereby fertilize barren grounds, and ſo aſſume the ſhape of Graſs and Corn, which a while before was in the form of Stones, Dung, Aſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that which was lately Graſs and Corn, preſently by the Ferment of an Animal, becomes Blood, Milk, and Fleſh, of a Beaſt; theſe again by a putrid ſolution of the <hi>Compage,</hi> are tranſmuted into Worms, Flies, and other Inſects, which often retain ſome ſhape of the Animal whence they proceed; and that which even now was in the ſhape of a Beaſt, as Beef, Mutton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is forthwith by the Ferment of an

Yea further, as Vegetables and Animals have their original from and are reducible in water, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Minerals and Metals. And though this is not ſo demonſtrable as the former, becauſe we have not that occaſion uſually to converſe with the Subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Products, as with Vegetables and Animals; yet I find to this purpoſe, what the Learned Squire <hi>Boyle</hi> cites out of a <hi>French</hi> Author, Monſieur <hi>De Rochas,</hi> who, as a Chymiſt, ſpeaking what he could perform by water, <q>Having (ſaith he) diſcerned ſuch great wonders, by the natural operation of water, I would know what may be done with it by Art, imitating Nature; wherefore I took wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I well knew, not to be compounded nor mixed with any other thing, than the Spirit of Life; and with an heat artificial, continual and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, I prepared and diſpoſed it by graduations, of coagulation, congelation, and fixation, until it was turn'd into earth; which earth produced Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, Vegetables and Minerals; the Animals did move of themſelves, eat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by the true Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy I made of them, I found they were compos'd of much Sulphur, little Mercury, and leſs Salt: The Minerals began to grow and encreaſe, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting into their own Nature one part of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:41152:143"/>earth; they were ſolid and heavy, and by this tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrative Science, namely Chymiſtry, I found they were compoſed of much Salt, little Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and leſs Mercury.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which Experiment, according to the relation of the Author, Minerals were generated out of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I ſuppoſe was done by ſome Mineral Seeds, or the <hi>Analyſis</hi> of ſome Mineral Concretes, into their ſecondary Principles, which by due digeſtions aſſum'd Water for their bodies. For Mineral Seeds in their due <hi>Matrixes,</hi> concenter water more or leſs according to the nature of the Seed, and fitneſs of the place; and accordingly give more or leſs <hi>pondus,</hi> as the purity of the Seed and diſpoſition of the place is; whence are lighter and heavier Minerals and Metals.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Metals are reducible into water, witneſs what the foreſaid Author ſaith, That by a certain artificial way of handling Mercury, without any addition, may be ſeparated therefrom, a fourth, or fifth part of water, or clear liquor, which for ought I have heard, or ſeen (ſaith he) is not reducible into Mercury again, and ſo is more then a disguiſe.</p>
                  <p>That Mercury, or rather Quickſilver, ſhould in its weight to the like bulk of Water, be as four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen to one, is from the Seed of the Quickſilver, concentring the body of water, according to that proportion; towards whoſe reduction, two credible Perſons told the foreſaid Ingenuous Author, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as he ſaith) many trials which they made, to reduce Mercury into Water, in order to Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal work, they did once by divers Cohobations, reduce a pound of Mercury into almoſt a pound of water; and this without the addition of any other thing, but onely by preſſing the Quickſilver by a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:41152:143"/>skilful managed Fire, in purpoſely-contriv'd veſſels. To the like purpoſe <hi>Iſaac Holland</hi> and ſome others, ſpeak of ſeparating a water from Quickſilver, which they call <hi>Aqua Nubis, quâ tanquam Hydrops, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius turget.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to mention the experiment of increaſing the bulk of a ſtone, by the ſingle addition of fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, till it ſwell to the bigneſs, and figure of the glaſs it's put into; for we ſee, that water needs no more then a petrefying Seed, to compreſs it ſelf, or other things it meets with, whether Vegetables or the like, into a ſtony concretion; as for inſtance, the petrefying well at <hi>Knarsborough,</hi> which hath, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, wrought the earth, and graſs thereabouts, into a rocky <hi>Compages,</hi> with petrefied Iſicles hanging down, where the very Streams of water, as they run along, are actually congealed into ſtones, which (I ſay) can be from nothing els, ſave a petrefying Seed, connatural to that ſort of water.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Succus lapidificus,</hi> may haue its Seminals (I ſay) from a petrefying Nitre, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of the learned <hi>Kircher, Si ſaxum inquit, quodcun<expan>

                  <p>So that underſtanding the nature of a petrefying Seed, and the extent of ſubterraneall Channels, from
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41152:144"/>the Sea at great diſtances upon the Land, we need not wonder, that ſome fiſh is digged up in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces petrified; ſeveral of which was to be ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>John Tradeſcan</hi>'s Rarityes. That there are Subterraneal Channels, not onely from one ſea to another, but from the ſeas, at very great diſtances upon the land, the Ingenuous <hi>Kircher</hi> doth fully demonſtrate. The firſt by a <hi>Dolphin,</hi> which was taken in the Red Sea; which by the command of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the place, was put into the water again <hi>cum laminis in bronchia inſertis</hi> with theſe words in <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters ingraven <hi>Amed Abdalla Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa Sues tibi vitam, unà cum hoc munere donavit, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Hegira,</hi> 720: which Dolphin was, the very ſame year, taken in the <hi>Mediterranean Sea, prope Damiatam,</hi> which could not poſſibly be, that the <hi>Dolohin</hi> ſhould ſwim that vaſt compaſs, round <hi>Affrica,</hi> and take in at the <hi>Streits,</hi> and ſo up to the furtheſt part of the <hi>Mediterranean Sea:</hi> whereas from the <hi>Mare rubrum</hi> to <hi>Damiata,</hi> is but a ſmall neck of land, little above 30 Miles; and therefore muſt paſs along thoſe ſubterraneal channels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one Sea communicates with another.</p>
                  <p>As there are Subterraneal paſſages, from one ſea to another; ſo (as I ſaid) from the ſeas, to great diſtances upon the land; whence all Fountains, Springs, and Rivers, have their Original, and return again into the ſea, contrary to the opinion of Dr. <hi>Wittie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which Subterraneal currents, the things carryed along with the water, whether fiſh or the like, may (when they come in places, pregnant with a petre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſeed) become congealed into a ſtone, from which lapidifying Juyce, all Stones, whether Rocks, Quarryes, Marcaſites, or what Stones ſoever, within, or upon the ſurface of the earth, had their concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion originally.</p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:41152:144"/>
                  <p>Hence is the reaſon, why ſome Animals are found incloſed in ſome Stones, or other Mineral concretions; as for inſtance, that a Toad ſhould be found alive in the midſt of a Stone: or that a Spider, or other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect ſhould be found in a peice of <hi>Amber.</hi> It is (I ſay) becauſe theſe Animals are there, whilſt theſe Stony, or other Mineral Concretions are in <hi>Succo;</hi> for <hi>Amber</hi> is of late, found to be a Mineral, and no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Sea, as it was uſually ſuppos'd. There is lately a Mine thereof found in <hi>Germany,</hi> which brings in a great profit, to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> It conſiſts chiefly, of a ſulphur, and a Salt, as we find by the diſtillation, and rectification thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now all Minerals are, or have been, at ſome time or other, <hi>in ſuis Principiis,</hi> in their firſt Succulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; in which at the time of Concretion, if any other thing happen to be there, it's wrap't up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it; which keeping the incloſed bodies from the air, and conſequently from any <hi>Analytical</hi> putrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are as a conſtant defenſive Balſam, preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them perpetually from corruption.</p>
                  <p>All Mineral Seed is inviſible, and to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves viſible, according to the appointment of God in nature, having got ſutable <hi>Matrixes,</hi> begin, by a Subterraneal heat, peculiar to the place, to work upon the Element of water, which it impregnates, and tranſmutes into a Mineral Juice; in which Juyce, the Seed begins to work it ſelf into a Mineral Mercury, and Sulphur, and in ſome places, into a Mineral Salt.</p>
                  <p>Now according to the purity or impurity, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility or fixity of the Sulphur, ſo becomes the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, more or leſs pure, retaining a Specifical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, from the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> of the Seed: Amongſt which, ſome have their Mercurial parts ſtained with
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:41152:145"/>a malignant Arſenical Sulphur, <hi>viz. Realgar, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripigmentum, Antimony &amp;c.</hi> but if the Sulphur be ſo ſtrong, as in its union with the Mercury, it rejects the moſt Heterogeneities, which uſually in Mineral productions, adhere thereto, then doth this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of the Sulphur, and Mercury, ariſe to a Metalline <hi>Compages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, The firſt ſpecification of the Mineral Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Mercury, is into Quickſilver, or Metalline Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; the next coagulation of Mercury, after the rejection of ſome Heterogeneal <hi>Sordes</hi> by Sulphur, is <hi>Saturnine,</hi> where the Mineral Seed, firſt puts on a Metalline form, which is called <hi>Saturn,</hi> or Lead, whoſe Mineral is <hi>Antimony;</hi> when or where this Sulphur becomes more depurated, it coagulates the Metalline <hi>Mercury,</hi> into <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or Tinn: But if the ſulphur attain a <hi>Solar</hi> tincture, and yet retain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny permiſcible Heterogeneities, it coagulates the Metalline Mercury, into <hi>Mars,</hi> or Iron; If this Sulphur, in its <hi>Solar</hi> tincture, receive a depuration of ſome of the aforeſaid Heterogeneities, it coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates into <hi>Venus,</hi> or Copper, which comes nigh in tincture, but is farr ſhort in <hi>Pondus,</hi> of <hi>Sol</hi> or Gold; for as <hi>Baſil ius Valentinus</hi> ſaith, that in <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> lodge <hi>Solar</hi> tinctures, which, gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by Nature, or Art, are deducible into <hi>Sol:</hi> and that, becauſe the ſoul or ſeed of <hi>Sol,</hi> is found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and not onely in them, but in their Minerals where they are nearer to their <hi>Primum ens;</hi> in which alſo (by the way) doth lodge the <hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if this <hi>Sulphur</hi> be ſo far graduated, as that there is a through-ſeparation of all Heterogeneities; and that the <hi>Sulphur</hi> hath almoſt inſeparably united it Self with the <hi>Mercury,</hi> then they are coagulated
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:41152:145"/>into <hi>Luna</hi> or Silver: which though it come ſhort both in Tincture, and <hi>Pondus</hi> of <hi>Sol,</hi> yet becauſe there is a total ſeparation of Heterogeneities, it lies in the direct road, by further maturation to both, and thereby to become <hi>Sol</hi> it ſelf, which is <hi>Apex Metallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the prefecteſt of Metals: whoſe Sulphur and Mercury are inſeperably united, and by maturation graduated in tincture and <hi>pondus,</hi> to this unary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the beſt of Metals.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how Water the primary Element, by the ſpermatick effloreſcence of a Mineral Seed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes wrought into a Mineral Juyce; and that, by a peculiar fermentation, is turned into a Mercury, and Sulphur: and thoſe again by maturating or ripening, each other, according to the degrees of the purity of the Sulphur, rejection of Heterogeneities, and union together, become tranſmuted, or rather, exalted into metalline Bodies, where at length, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the concentration of the metalline Seed, puts on the <hi>Pondus</hi> and tincture of Metals.</p>
                  <p>As the Seeds of Minerals are inviſible, ſo likewiſe are the Seeds of Vegetables and Animals; as for Vegetables, indeed the grain, or husk (which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly called Seed) we ſee; but the prolifique part thereof, which is truely the Seed, cannot be diſcerned, by the moſt acurate artificially contriv'd <hi>Mieroſcropes;</hi> being as the <hi>Coſmopolite</hi> ſaith (his manner of computation I know not,) but the 820th. part of the viſible grain: however they are ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, as not to fall under the ſenſe of our Opticks, though helped with the beſt contriv'd glaſſes; and although ſome plants are propagable otherwiſe then by Seed (I mean, then by the husk (where uſually the Seed works) as Roſemary, Mint, Sage <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe tops, or ſlips ſet in the ground, take from
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41152:146"/>whence they grow, and increaſe) yet in ſuch as alſo in the Scions, Imps, and Grafts of fruit Trees, the ſeed or prolifique part is diſperſed, almoſt though the whole body of the Plants, and Trees; whoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of aſſuming a body from the <hi>leffas terrae;</hi> and of that from the Element of Water, I have already deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>And as I have ſhewed the progreſs of Vegetable, and Mineral Seed from Water, into all the viſible clothings of their bodies; ſo now I would obſerve to my ſelf, how the Animal Seed, works upon that, which originally is Water: and from that, doth ſhape it ſelf, according to the appointment of God, into a body conſiſting of Blood, Fleſh, Bones, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, Nerves, Arteryes, Head, Stomach, Heart, Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the <hi>Sperme</hi> it ſelf is nothing elſe ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, but Water altered by the ſeveral Ferments of the body, and circulated in the Seminal veſels, till it becomes impregnate, with an effloreſcence of the whole body, which indeed is the Seed, or prolifique part thereof; for the <hi>Sperm</hi> is onely the receptacle, or vehicle of that Seed. Now when the effloreſcence becomes maturated (For a Child Chicken <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilſt ſuch, are not capable of prapagating their like) and that the <hi>Spermatick liquor</hi> is throughly digeſted, in the veſſels adapted for that purpoſe; then begins that <hi>Titillatio</hi> (that ſixth ſenſe according to <hi>Scaliger</hi>) or <hi>Prurigo Venerea,</hi> by which, being conveighed into a proper capacitated <hi>Matrix,</hi> the effloreſcence of the Maſculine Seed, doth impregnate, or breath upon (for I know not how better to expreſs it, then by a kind of occult breathing) the Female paſſive Seed, which is a Juyce, preparable from all the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Female body, and alſo circulated in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:41152:146"/>their proper <hi>Spermatick</hi> veſſels, which conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Matrix,</hi> receives that prolifique <hi>Halitus</hi> or breath of the Male's effloreſcence; and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with the reception of a very ſmall part of the <hi>Sperme,</hi> the body of which, is moſtwhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and the very prolifique odour or breath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of retained, which doth become <hi>Succum foemininum, qui complet (ſecundum Dei Opt.

Another cauſe of ſterility, or barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, <hi>Quùm uterus ſemen malè imbutum, ſemel recipiens, illud rejecit, nec deinceps ſe aperit, ut intrò ſugat invitum iſtius viri ſemen;</hi> for many times, a woman conceives by the ſecond husband, though ſhe had been (as it were) barren to the firſt.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Embryon Anchorite,</hi> in its firſt rudiments, is very ſmall, and yet hath the exact proportion of all the parts belonging to the humane body; as I have ſeen it, in an abortion, ſcarce half ſo big as my little finger, at about ten weeks after Conception, which yet hath had an uniform <hi>Symetry</hi> of parts, with a viſible difference of the Sex; whoſe conſtituent Principles hath been ſo tender and near to its primary <hi>Spermatick liquor,</hi> as that it hath, <hi>ſuâ spoute, liquated,</hi> or melted into its primitive Juyce, or <hi>Liquor</hi> it ſwam in; and that becauſe the tender <hi>Embryo</hi> is very near, to its <hi>Succus ſolutus</hi> or <hi>Primum Ens</hi> (if I may ſo call it) and therefore, eaſily reducible thereinto.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Plaſtick ſpirit</hi> which is in the Seed, and forms the <hi>Embryo,</hi> is that which we call the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or <hi>Faber Plaſticus,</hi> which by degrees (all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſes cooperating) awaken the Powers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending eſſentially upon the ſeminal Principles, forms the parts, brings forth the Ferments, ſtrikes the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fire in the heart, whence ſprings up the <hi>Anima ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiva, illuminates</hi> the blood, and Animal functions, with the <hi>Aura vitalis;</hi> and ſo out of one thing, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, the reaſon why women (during the time of Conception, and Maturation of the <hi>Foetus</hi>) are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſick by fits, and have many troubleſome <hi>Symptoms</hi> upon them, even many times, till after the birth, is, becauſe after the nouriſhment of the <hi>Foetus</hi> which onely takes the pureſt parts, and moſt defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Juyce of the Mothers blood, for its refection; the remaining <hi>Sordes</hi> are many, eſpecially the Womb being the <hi>Cloaca Humorum,</hi> which now not being carried away by the uſual Emunctories of the Womb, do regurgitate into other parts, vitiates their Ferments, alters the tone of the membranous parts, diſturbs the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the blood, whence ariſe Gripings, Vomitings, Nauſeatings, Pains in the Head, Pains and Weakneſs in the Back, <hi>Febricula's</hi> yea ſometimes Feavers in an high degree <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which alſo happen, many times, to women who have not conceived, having <hi>aliquid amplius,</hi> and are denied the benefit of natural evacuation, by that Emunctory; and therefore are ſubject to the like paſſions, and diſorders of health, as thoſe with Child are; who are many times apt to romitings, though indeed,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:41152:148"/>there is another cauſe of the frequent illneſs of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, which now I have not time to mention, but it hath relation to what was mentioned in the foregoing Page.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to uſe gentle purgations, even in the firſt months after Conception, is not ſo dangerous as Phyſicians uſually ſuppoſe; and not onely harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but alſo of great uſe for preventing bad fits, and making them more healthful, during the time of being with child: Nay I have known pretty ſtrong purges given, ſoon after conception, which hath wrought pretty ſmartly, and yet no prejudice at all to the <hi>Foetus;</hi> ſo that Phyſicians need not be ſo curious, nor women at that time ſo cautious as by denying them the benefit of gentle purges, to prevent them of that healthfulneſs, which otherwiſe they might much more happily enjoy, then otherwiſe they do.</p>
                  <p>That there is a Sympathetical combination betwixt the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and the Stomach, is evident; both becauſe, if a good <hi>Uterine</hi> medicine be given, in caſes of <hi>Uterine</hi> diſcompoſures, that many times, whilſt the Medicine is yet in the ſtomach, hath an influence upon the <hi>Matrix</hi> compoſing the diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, and allaying the <hi>Furibund</hi> inragements of that unquiet Animal; as alſo in caſes of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of birth, I know a certain <hi>Specifick,</hi> of whoſe efficacy I have had frequent experience, even to admiration: Which while it is yet in the Stomach (eſpecially if the birth be brought to Maturity) it opens the mouth of the womb, enlargeth the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, unhingeth the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> and making the throws effectual, expelleth the <hi>Foetus</hi> whether dead, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, which I have experienced upon ſeveral Women, that have laboured, one, two, or ſometimes three
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:41152:149"/>daies in vain, and within half, or a whole hour, have been very ſafely delivered; with the ſame and ſome other additions, I have known a <hi>Mola</hi> expell'd out of the womb, almoſt as big as my head; and to expel the after-birth (thoſe <hi>Quiſquiliae Matricis</hi>) nothing is more effectual; and all this, from the influential vertue of a Medicine (whilſt in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach) upon the Womb. But to return:</p>
                  <p>All the Nutriment which the <hi>Foetus</hi> hath, is either from the blood, which in young women, or ſuch as do not conceive, gives matter for the Natural eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations; or from the <hi>Succus Spermaticus</hi> digeſted, by a peculiar Ferment of the parts it is circulated in: both which, ſaving that they receive a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and determinate difference by Ferments, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially nothing els, but water; out of which by the power of the <hi>Plaſtick Spirit,</hi> is the <hi>Foetus</hi> form'd, both as to the parts containing and contained, <hi>viz.</hi> both as to the ſolid parts and veſſels, as Juyces <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the ſpecifical Ferments, are peculiarly inherent, in the <hi>Syngamical Spermatick Liquor,</hi> which being gradually tranſmuted into blood, by a further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation of the <hi>Spermatick</hi> Principles, becomes fettled in ſeveral parts of the body, after the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner.</p>
                  <p>The Plaſtick <hi>Faber</hi> lurking in the <hi>Spermatick</hi> Juyce, begins to hew forth the form of an humane <hi>Embryo,</hi> out of that Albuminous liquor which is brought in, together with the blood, from the Maſs thereof, as Materials for this Animal Fabrick; ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of theſe two, by the <hi>Energy</hi> of its own power, it ſhapes the body, gives a current to the newly ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Juyces, in their own pellicles or membranes, and begins to make theſe Juyces circulate, which as they circulate, are coagulated upon the Solid
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:41152:149"/>parts, whence the <hi>Accretion</hi> thereof, and upon ſome particular parts they impreſs a tincture, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a ſeminal Character, being ſome ſeparable parts of the circulating juyces which by further maturation become radicated and eſſential Ferments, but are not yet vital, till they are inſpired with the <hi>Aura vitalis:</hi> thus one riſeth up after another in the wheel of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and thus all the powers and ſeminal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the prolifick <hi>Sperme,</hi> become awakened one after another, until the <hi>Foetus</hi> become complete. Now, I ſay, the Ferments are nothing but levened parts, ſeparable from the primary Spermatick Juy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with a ſeminal impreſſion, which makes them Eſſential agents, eſpecially after their illumination by the <hi>Aura vitalis;</hi> till then; they act not; and after that ceaſeth, their operation alſo is at an end; for all the Art we have, cannot make them perform the wonted Tranſmutations, after, as before death; and therefore as to their ſeminal impreſſions, they are (as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith) indemonſtrable <hi>à priori,</hi> becauſe they owe their ſpecifical <hi>Energy</hi> of Tranſmutation immediately to the Seed and <hi>Plaſtick</hi> power thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now the Elementary Juyces, and blood brought into the <hi>Matrix,</hi> are nothing elſe but a <hi>Carva</hi> of water, and ſo alſo the blood and ſucculent parts of the <hi>Embryo</hi> are the ſame, yet further remov'd by additional Ferments; for the <hi>Plaſtick</hi> Spirit awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Ferments and <hi>Anima ſenſitiva</hi> out of its own boſom; and by the mediation of the Ferments, makes all thoſe Tranſmutations, requiſite for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and growth of the <hi>Foetus.</hi> The ſubject matter that the Ferments work upon is water; from this by the alteration thereof (as I ſaid) by Ferments, our bodies are ſhaped, nouriſhed, and increaſed in the womb; and after that, when we are brought forth,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:41152:150"/>we feed upon Milk generally, and that either of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Milk, which is nothing but water or the ſuccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts of Meat and Drink, altered firſt by the Ferment of the Concrete we feed upon, and next by the Ferment of the ſtomach and Inteſtines, and laſtly by the Ferments of the Breaſts themſelves, which perfects the <hi>Lucteous Cremor,</hi> or Milky Juyce, paſſing from the Inteſtines, by the <hi>Venae lactae, glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutes,</hi> and <hi>Thoraical</hi> veſſels, through the <hi>Mammilary</hi> Conduits into the breaſts themſelves; or of Cows milk, which is nothing elſe but water, firſt altered by Seed out of the <hi>Leffas terrae</hi> into Vegetables, and then again altered by the Ferment of the Cows ſtomach, and laſtly is complered by the Ferment of the duggs.</p>
                  <p>When we grow up to feed upon ſtronger meat, as fleſh and the like, this is nothing but the foreſaid <hi>Cremor</hi> or milky Juyce, tranſmuted, by other Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, into fleſh: For we ſee that when Cows are dried of their Milk, and have good Paſtures, that they then fatten a pace; becauſe that which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe paſſeth into milk, and by the plenty thereof keeps them poor, is now, by other Ferments coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into fleſh, ſo that fleſh is but water, yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remov'd by Ferments. And as for bread, which is the ſtaff of Life, that, I mean Corn, may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt Vegetables, which (with them) hath its Original from the <hi>Leffas,</hi> and that from water, and is only altered in its ſhape, from the ſeed thereof, which gives difference to all things.</p>
                  <p>And for our Drink (as I ſhewed before) it's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but water, which, whether it appear under the form of Wine, Sider, Perry, Ale, Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is nothing but the diſguiſes of water, altered only by Seed and Ferments. Thus like Plants we grow from water, as if indeed we had taken rooting therefrom,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:41152:150"/>and like <hi>Amphibions</hi> we live, and walk upon the face of the Earth, whilſt we feed upon water.</p>
                  <p>Alſo we grow and increaſe in bulk, from water, until we come to our full ſtature, and then the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are moſt vigorous and active; for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Animals, the Ferments are very languid, eſpecially (I ſay) in the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and therefore the Tranſmutations they make, are but very ſlender and <hi>tennious;</hi> whence is the facil reduction of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute <hi>Embryo</hi> into its firſt <hi>Spermatick</hi> Juyce or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Liquor. In Children the Ferments grow ſtronger, but yet is very weak; whence is their apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to breed worms, which proceed from a debilitude of the embalming Ferments: as Children grow up in years, the Ferments grow more ſtrong, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they require ſtronger meat, and the Tranſmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Ferments are more vigorous; whence the bones and fleſh of young Men, become more ſolid and firm; and that increaſeth till the body come to its full ſtature: ſo that it is the vigour of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that gives flower and ſtrength to the body, and their defects give being to Diſeaſes, make the Spirits flag, the ſinews ſhrink, and the fleſh waſt away, by a lingring <hi>Tabes;</hi> and that too, oftentimes in the very ſpring of Youth; even, many times, whilſt we are upon the <hi>Meridian</hi> of our days, occaſionally from the aſſaults of many Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>When we are once arrived to the <hi>Zenith</hi> of our Years, that the florid ſtrength of our bodies, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable <hi>Indexes</hi> of the agil vigour of our Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and vital Functions, we ſtay not long here, but then begin to decline and to go down the hill; our ſtrength begins gradually to be impaired, and that, becauſe our Ferments and Vital Powers (when once mounted to their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) are <hi>labil</hi> and in continual
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:41152:151"/>Flux (for ſo all mortal powers are, they begin, grow, come to their full ſtate, decline and come to a Period, either by a further tranſmutation, or reduction into the firſt <hi>Hyle</hi> or primitive <hi>Chaos</hi>) therefore they ſpontaneouſly decay, and with them the Fabrick of the ſolid parts of the body; ſo that old Men that live out the full number of days, do but ſpin forth a longer conſumptive thread, than others; they wear away with an inſenſible <hi>Tabes,</hi> having their ſucculent parts dried up by the exiccating <hi>Blaſs</hi> of the Air, and that through the deficiencies of the vital Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>And thus Old Age performs that, at the long run, which a lingring Diſeaſe, whoſe Seminals are deeply ſeated in any principal part, as ſtomach, lungs, liver, veins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vitiating the Ferment thereof, doth in a leſs time, as perhaps in a year, half a year, three months or leſs, <hi>viz.</hi> wear away the body by a continual waſting or Conſumption until the parts are reduced to a <hi>Skeleton,</hi> which being after entombed in the earth, doth (as all other bodies) by the <hi>fracedinous</hi> odour thereof, <hi>Fatiſcere in ſuccum ſuum primitivum, legeſque aquae ſubire,</hi> turns into a ſort of <hi>Leffas,</hi> and that, by a further reduction is nothing elſe but water; not to ſay, what a great quantity of <hi>effluvia</hi> or vapours (which for the moſt part are materially water) paſs continually through the pores of our bodies; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if duly computed, not much leſs than the one half of the weight of the food we take in, and yet is nothing but water circulated in our bodies, through various Fermentations, and at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to its primitive ſimplicity.</p>
                  <p>Thus we begin, we grow, we come to our full ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from the operation of Seed and Ferments upon water, whoſe degrees of vigour upon the material
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:41152:151"/>ſtage thereof, gives the various <hi>Stadiums</hi> of Life: Then we bend to Diſeaſes, we decline, we die; when the vital Powers and formal Ferments march off the ſtage, and have their <hi>exit</hi> into their primitive <hi>Hyle,</hi> and the body then, ultimately reducible into water by the <hi>Fracedo</hi> of the Grave. Hence I conclude all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the <hi>Mundane Syſtem,</hi> whether Vegetable, Animal or Mineral, from water as the material Element, and by Seed as the efficient Agent, have not only the Beginning, But</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX Concerning the ORIGINAL of <hi>SPRINGS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not the leaſt part of Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi>'s Book, to Diſcourſe of the Original of Springs, and therein to aſſert their original to be from Rain and Snow-water; from the confluence of which two, he ſuppoſeth all Springs to flow: and that after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> the Snow and Rain, falling from the Clouds in great abundance upon the Earth, do by moiſtening the <hi>Superficies,</hi> cauſe it to bring forth Vegetables; which we grant, <hi>viz.</hi> That the moiſture exhal'd from the Sea and Earth, carryed up into the Clouds, becomes impregnated with an influential Nitrous Salt, or <hi>Sal Hermeticum</hi> (floting to and again in the Atmoſphere) And cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated or cohobated upon its <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> the Earth gives fertility to the ground, and makes it apt to bring forth Vegetables.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The remaining part, ſaith he (except what ſuddenly runs into Rivers) ſinks down by ſecret paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41152:153"/>into the earth, with which the <hi>Superficies</hi> doth abound; and in rocky ground it runs through the clefts, and by them is conveyed to the Subterraneal Chanels more or leſs deep, in the earth, where it is concocted by the earth, and moves as blood in the veins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſhall indeed admit thus far of what he ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> That Rain and Snow-water are the proximate cauſe of all Land-Springs and ſudden Flouds, ſilling the Poroſities and Chanels of the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth, the remaining part reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, till it find declive Currents out of Brooks and Ditches into other Rivulets, and thoſe again, by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages, ſwell into Rivers, and thereby cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations of low grounds, till thoſe Rivers empty themſelves, by other intermediate ones, into the Sea it ſelf: But that the ſame ſhould be the cauſe of the <hi>Fontes perennes, viz.</hi> of Living Springs, I altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deny, as ſhall afterwards be evinc'd more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Water (ſaith he) at length, in its paſſage through the veins of the Earth, finds vent, and runs forth; which place of eruption we call a Spring or Fountain: And this ſpringing forth or eruption of the water, I conceive (ſaith he) to be made from its own natural inclination and tendency towards its proper place, aſſigned to it by the Creator, which is the convex part of the earth, it not reſting till it meets with its natural correſpondent, the Air; under which it muſt needs lie, becauſe of its greater gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as above the Earth, by reaſon of its levity: And this I think (ſaith he) to be the natural reaſon of its ebullition out of the Earth,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Here the Doctor hath at once conceiv'd and brought forth the cauſes (as he ſuppoſeth) of all manner of Springs, and their manner of iſſuing out
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:41152:153"/>of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> from rain and Snow-Water, and their tendency in the Channels of the Earth, to their proper place the convex part thereof, For he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving numbred three general Opinions, concerning the Original of Springs, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt by percolation of the Sea. ſecondly by tranſmutation of Earth, or Air into Water, within the Bowels of the Earth. Or laſtly by Rain or Snow, with the laſt of which he cloſeth. As for the ſecond <hi>viz.</hi> the Opinion of the tranſmutation of Earth into Water for the ſupply of Springs, it's ſo abſurd, that its enough to name it although the Dr. is too credulous, in telling us, he can eaſily believe, That the thinner part of the Earth, may be turned into Water, as alſo the groſſer parts of Water, into Earth: So the thinner and more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile parts of Water, into Air, and the groſſer parts of Air, into Water, arguing a Tranſmutability of the Quaternary of Elements amongſt themſelves: which I wiſh, he could make me believe too, by any ocular demonſtration.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As for that Tranſmutation of Air into Water, for the ſuppoſed ſupply of Springs, it's <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s opinion; and Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> denying this <hi>Theſis,</hi> yet ſaith, that reaſon tells us, that more then ten parts of Air, will not ſerve for the making but of one part of Water, I think (ſaith he by <hi>Parentheſis</hi>) twenty would be to little. But if I ſhould be heard to ſpeak in this caſe, it ſhould be Paradoxical; and that thus <hi>(viz.)</hi> that five parts of Air, would be too much, and five thouſand parts thereof, would be too little, for the making one part of Water.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I ſhall therefore firſt, endeavour to impugne his <hi>Theſis</hi> of Snow, and Rain-Water, to be the Original of all Springs, by being Negative therein: Next to which, I ſhall, aſſume a poſitive <hi>Theſis,</hi> from
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:41152:154"/>the Circulation of Water in the Terraqueous Globe, by the mediation of Subterraneal Chanels, from Sea, to Sea: yea and from the Sea, to the Heads of Springs, from them into Rivulets, and thoſe again into Rivers, and thoſe into the Ocean, and ſo circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late round.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Firſt therefore that Snow, and Rain-Water, ſhould give Original to living Springs (as we call them) cannot be, becauſe then upon deficiency of Snow and Rain-Water, as uſually happens, in long droughts, theſe Springs would certainly fail: But we find the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that in long continued droughts, when all Land-Springs are thereby dried, that yet the true Quick Springs are as fluent as ever. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not fed by Snow or Rain-Water. I cannot indeed, deny but that Quick-ſprings, are not without their additional ſupplies, from Land-Springs which are fed by Snow or Rain-Water; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon may, in long droughts (having thoſe auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries drawn off) become leſs able to manage that ſtrong current they had before: yet doth it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, but that theſe Springs, when ſolitary, fetch their Original deeper then Rain Water can ſink.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Yea, ſuppoſe we ſhould grant, that ſome few of theſe Quick-Springs, ſhould (for the generality of them do not) prove deficient through long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued droughts: yet this may very probably happen upon a double account. Firſt, becauſe the Quick-Spring it ſelf may be lengthened, by the additional ſupply of a Land-ſpring, being (ſuppoſe) but an arme of that larger Channel, which is carried under ground, at a greater diſtance, to another Spring, of a more ſtrong current; and therefore a drought, taking away its Auxiliaries, may thereby break off an arm, and make it run in its ſtrong ſingle Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:41152:154"/>along the <hi>Sabulum bulliens,</hi> to an other Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, where it glides currently away.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The next reaſon, why ſome few Quick-Springs (as I ſaid) may in long droughts prove dry'd up, is, becauſe the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the earth, is ſo exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that Natural moyſture, which ſhould ſupple it for Vegetation, and the like; as that it imbibes it into its ſelf like a Spung, and the Spring ſpends its ſtock, to moyſten the thirſty earth about it, and ſo proves deficient in its current, But when the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes again ſatiated, by irrigating ſhowers, then, that which before was diverted to moyſten the Earth, finds its Channel again, and runs as fluently as ever.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The ſecond reaſon, why Springs have not their Original from Snow and Rain-Water, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we find Springs break forth upon the tops of Hills, or Mountains, which flow, even in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt droughts: Now if Rain-Water ſhould at that ſeaſon, onely ſupply them, then of neceſſity, upon want of Rain, and continuance of long droughts, theſe muſt be dryed up; yea, and that very ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, becauſe they want a ſupply, from their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential conſtituent Cauſe, which according to his <hi>Theſis</hi> is Snow or Rain-water: But, by experience, we find the contrary, <hi>(viz)</hi> that Quick-Springs, even in long droughts, do keep their current; therefore Snow and Rain-Water are not the conſtituent, or efficient Cauſe of Quick-Springs.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The third reaſon, that makes me ſcruple the Veracity of this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> is, becauſe neither the Dr. nor the reſt of the Aſſertors thereof, have duly aſſign'd the manner, or Method, the Pipes, Channels, or Conduits, how Springs, having their Original from Snow, or Rain, ſhould aſcend and mount the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41152:155"/>tops of Hills, and ſpring forth in the uppermoſt parts of high Heaths: And why upon the truth of the aſſertion, they ſhould not rather alwayes be thruſt down into Vallies, and confin'd to low, declive places, as being more proper for the heavy body of Water (according to their own ſuppoſition, of its being next in weight to Earth) to deſcend then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (as they ſay) to the nature thereof to aſcend: To make Water climb a Hill, forcing it <hi>volens nolens</hi> up the inſide, when all the contrivance they have cannot do the ſame upon the outſide thereof. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they ſhould have indeavoured to have extrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves, and the world from theſe ſuſpicious doubts, before they had impos'd their <hi>Theſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. For, by this ſuppoſition, a great part of Rain-Water, falling (for the ſupply of Springs) ſinks down, by ſecret paſſages, into the Earth; What then muſt force this Water, contrary to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination up the bank, to make it ſpring forth out of the tops of Hills, and high places? Surely the contrivers of this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> had not their eyes every way, did not caſt about, to ſalve all the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this Doctrine. All the reaſon I find Dr. <hi>Wittie,</hi> gives, for its Ebullition out of the Earth, is a tendency towards its proper place, which is the convex part of the Earth: By which, it ſhould ſeem, that the Water (while in the Bowels of the Earth) is out of its place, and therefore muſt by a certain force, <hi>ab extra</hi> as to its ſelf, be reduc'd to its natural place. What this ſhould be, that may make the Water recoyle, or drive upward, contrary to it: own Nature, the Doctor would have done well to have aſſign'd; For no body can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have a natural tendency, in that where a force is impos'd; but here is a natural tendency to the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:41152:155"/>proper place, <hi>viz.</hi> the convex part of the Earth; and yet this is carryed upwards, a contrary motion to that that is proper to water: ſo that, in good earneſt, it implyes no leſs then a tacit contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p n="13">13. For he expreſly ſaith, That the Springing forth, or Eruption of the Water, is not made by any forcible agitation, compulſion, or violence that is put upon it, <hi>ab extra,</hi> within the Earth <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but from its own natural inclination, and tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its proper place, <hi>viz.</hi> the convex part of the Earth: and yet theſe Springs ſometimes break forth, in the top of high Hills, and in the uppermoſt part of high Heaths, as (to go no further) that of <hi>Knars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough Spaw</hi> (the vitrioline I mean) is a pretty ſtrong Spring, and yet is upon the uppermoſt part of that high Heath, which in the greateſt droughts, ceaſeth not to ſpring: ſo that He and the followers of this opinion, muſt of neceſſity grant, that either it is not improper, for water to aſcend, and then they muſt aſſign the true efficient cauſes thereof, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Water, after it has fallen from the Clouds, and ſinks into the cavityes of the earth, up again to the <hi>Superficies</hi> thereof; and that too, to the tops of many high Hills: Or elſe they muſt retrive their Opinion, that the convex part of the Earth, is the proper place of the Water: For if water (as in many Springs it's found) aſcends, and breaks forth above the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of Plains, (and that too without any compulſive force) is a more firme argument, that the Water (whilſt there) is rather in its proper place, then when thruſt forth into <hi>declive</hi> Places, along the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex part of the earth, where it doth forthwith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo <hi>Hydraulick</hi> Laws, is ponderous, and runs down any <hi>Declive</hi> Current.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:41152:156"/>14. The arguments, Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> urgeth, for the confirming his Opinion of Rain, and Snow-Water, to be the Original of Springs, are Three. The firſt of which is, becauſe it is found by experience (ſaith he) that Fountains, and conſequently Rivers, are greater, and do abound more with Water in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and moyſt weather, than in Summer. To which I anſwer, That it's granted, that they do (indeed) abound more in Winter, and moyſt weather, but yet I deny, that therefore it ſhould follow, That Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Rivers ſhuuld have their Original there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: For it is onely Land-Springs, or (at the moſt) a Co-incidence of them with ſome few Quick-ſprings, that receive ſo great increaſe from Rain, and Snow Water, as joyned with <hi>declive</hi> Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Water, that run down Hills, Mountains, and other ſteep Places; which fill Rivers, make them overflow their banks, and drown the Fens, and other low grounds, in Winter, and ſometimes in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by great ſudden falls of Rain-Water: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Quick-Springs (ſaving their additionals, the Land-ſprings) are the ſame then, as at other times: I mean as to their own Channels, from their proper ſource.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Secondly, In thoſe years, when great floods of rain do fall in Summer, and great ſtore of Snow in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we find (ſaith he) Springs durable, whereas in droughty Seaſons, when there is but little, or no Rain, or Snow, the Springs dry up. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that firſt, as to the durablenes of thoſe <hi>Fontes perennes,</hi> the ſudden falls of Rain contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and that, becauſe they indure after the drein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, and exhauſting of the Land-Springs by continued droughts: Whereas if the continuance of theſe Quick-Springs, did depend upon thoſe falls of rain; then would they, in great droughts (being
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:41152:156"/>denied of their ſupply) alſo (as I ſaid before) ceaſe. The great plenty of water in wet Seaſons, do indeed (as I ſaid) ſet the Land-Springs a-flote (yea and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets other Springs that appear not at all in other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, witneſs the <hi>Gypſies</hi> in the <hi>Woulds</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire</hi>) which by the in-lets of Chanels each into other, may, for a time, increaſe the current of Quick-Springs, but adds nothing at all to its durableneſs; for the earth is no ſooner dreyned of the ſuperfluous water, which come by great falls of wet, but the living Springs (as they may not improperly be call'd) are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>in ſtatu quo prius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as to what he ſaith, That in droughty Seaſons, when there is but little or no Rain or Snow, the Springs dry up. As to the truth thereof, I ſhall (I ſay) appeal to the obſervations of all ſuch Perſons as have taken notice thereof. A ſure Proof of which, we had (he ſaith) in <hi>England,</hi> in the Years, 1654, 55 and 56, when our Climate was dryer than ever any Stories mention, ſo as, we had very little Rain in Summer, or Snow in Winter, moſt of our Springs were dryed up, even thoſe ſorts of Springs we call <hi>Fontes perennes:</hi> which (I ſay) as to matter of fact, the Country-People can teſtifie was not ſo: and though I grant, many Springs were, through the drought and penury of Rain-water dryed up, yet do I deny theſe to be Quick-Springs, excepting ſome few, which (as I ſaid before) might be diverted by the extream dryneſs of the adjacent thirſty ground, which might drink it up as it came, or by having its Auxiliaries of a Land-Spring drawn off; or laſtly, by having its current intercepted and carryed by longer ſtretch'd Subterraneal Chanels into other Springs. I muſt confeſs that it's more than probable that thoſe Land-Springs, which are ordinarily fed by Snow and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:41152:157"/>water, and which ſupply many Draw-Wells, were (indeed) dryed up, for the moſt part, in thoſe drough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Seaſons: but that the true Quick-Springs, thoſe I mean which always run along the <hi>Sabulum bulliens,</hi> or bubbling Sand, ſhould be dryed up in droughty Seaſons (excepting as aforeſaid) is neither agreeable to reaſon, or obſervation.</p>
            <p n="17">17. A third reaſon, which (ſaith he) perſwades to this original from Snow and Rain, is, Becauſe in thoſe Climates and Countries where little Rain falls, few or no Springs and Rivers are ſeen, as in the Deſarts of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and in moſt parts of <hi>Africa</hi> near the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> they have little water. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That though this ſeemingly be the moſt cogent Argument that Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> urgeth for the vindication of this Opinion; yet I ſee no more that it evinceth, than this <hi>(viz.)</hi> That in thoſe places where there are but rare falls of Rain-water, thoſe Auxiliarie helps, and conveyances by Land-Springs (which in other places by great daſhes of Rain, fill other Rivers very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) are moſtwhat cut off, and the ſimple Quick-Springs are left ſolitary, which as ſuch cannot make many Rivers, nor much ſwell thoſe already made.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Hence in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where it Rains very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they are ſupplyed, inſtead thereof, by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of <hi>Nilus;</hi> whoſe River begins to ariſe on the the Seventeenth of <hi>June,</hi> ſwelling by degrees until it mounts to (ſometimes) Twenty four Cubits, though heretofore Sixteen was the moſt it attained to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by that Image of <hi>Nilus,</hi> having Sixteen Children playing about it, brought from thence and dedicated to the gods by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> in his Temple of Peace, and now to be ſeen (as <hi>Sandys</hi> in his Travails faith) in the <hi>Vatican</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. Which conſtant riſing of <hi>Nilus</hi> at ſuch a day
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:41152:157"/>(as aforeſaid) is imputed by <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> unto the abundance of Rain falling on the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Mountains for Forty days together, at ſuch time, as the Sun approcheth <hi>Cancer;</hi> which is affirmed to be true (ſaith <hi>Sandys</hi>) by the Inhabitants of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who receive it from Strangers, frequenting <hi>Cairo,</hi> from ſundry parts of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and <hi>Libya,</hi> who come down with the floud, and bring with them Slaves, Monkies, Parrots, and ſuch like Commodities: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo before that time, for divers days, the Air is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, being full of black and ponderous Clouds, with a continual rumbling, threatning (as it were) to drown the whole Country, yet ſeldom ſo much as dropping, but are carryed Southward by the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Winds, which conſtantly blow at that Seaſon.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Now theſe Clouds, being kept together by theſe Northern Winds, and not ſuffered, by the force thereof, to be let down upon the Country of <hi>Aegypt</hi> in ſhowers, are upon the reverſion of the <hi>Peroledi,</hi> the ſoft Southern, or South-Eaſt Winds, wheeling from an other point, make the hovering Clouds diſcharge themſelve; in great Rain for many days together, which falling upon the Mountains of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi> are partly waſhed down from the Mountains, immediately into <hi>Nilus,</hi> and partly (running into intermediate Chanels and Rivulets amongſt the hills) are, at length, conveyed into <hi>Nilus,</hi> which together make the River gradually to ſwell, from the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>June,</hi> until the beginning of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> at which time, they cut the banks, and let it overflow the whole Country, for the enriching the Soyl there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Now that the overflowing of <hi>Nile,</hi> is from Rain let down near the head thereof (which is found to be in the Province of <hi>Agaos,</hi> near the Kingdom
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:41152:158"/>of <hi>Goia,</hi> in the Land called <hi>Sabala,</hi> in the top of a Mountain (whoſe Diameter is not paſt one Foot and an half) is (I ſay) further apparent, becauſe the temperature of the Air, all over the Country is the ſame at that time as it is in other places, where Rain falls in moiſt Seaſons: For we ſee in our own Iſland of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> where Rain happens fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that for ſome days together the Air will be ſo cloudy and moiſt (and yet kept off from ſhowers by Winds that bear them up) as that it moiſtens the walls and floors of Stone-buildings, and make the ſtones look wet and moiſt, as if it had actually rain'd upon them, when not a ſhower has happened for many days together.</p>
            <p n="22">22. In like manner (I ſay) the temperature of the Air in <hi>Aegypt</hi> at that Seaſon is very moiſt, yea ſo moiſt, as though we ſuppoſe it did rain, yet could it not be much more moiſt; a Demonſtration whereof, is this following Experiment, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of the earth of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> adjoyning to the River; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it carefully, that it neither come to be wet nor waſted; weigh it daily, and you ſhall find it neither more nor leſs heavy, until the Seventeenth of <hi>June,</hi> at which day it beginneth to grow more ponderous, and augmenteth with the augmentation of the River: Whereby they have, amongſt themſelves, an infallible knowledge of the State of the Deluge.</p>
            <p n="23">23. So that hence it clearly appears, that great falls of Rain upon the Mountains near the head-Spring of <hi>Nilus,</hi> at ſuch a Seaſon, give increaſe to that River; and that theſe Clouds, which contain that great quantity of water (which well nigh would threaten the drowning of the Country) is carryed over the face of the Land by Northern Winds, which meeting with other Winds from different quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:41152:158"/>are there ſtay'd, and let down in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Mountains of <hi>Aethiopia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. And whereas Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> ſaith, That in <hi>Aegypt</hi> there are no Springs at all, I am very much apt to ſuſpect the truth thereof; For how ſhould the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and Travellers in that Country, be ſupplyed with water (who Live and Travel at remote diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from <hi>Nile</hi>) both for themſelves and Cattle, their Camels, Aſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The waters they find, muſt needs be from Springs, and thoſe Quick-Springs too, becauſe no Rain falls on the Country, to cauſe any Land-Springs or Rivulets therefrom.</p>
            <p n="25">25. And although he ſeems to himſelf, to give a ſolution to that objection made by <hi>Seneca, viz.</hi> That the greateſt Rain that can fall, never ſinks above Ten Foot into the ground; by alleadging that though into the ſolid earth the Rain ſinks not above Ten Foot: yet, What becomes (ſaith he) of that immenſe quantity of Rain which continues for many Weeks together, nay oft times for ſome Moneths, beſide the infinite quantity of wet and Snow that is falling all Winter long, cauſing inundations of water over all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round about? Can it be ſuppos'd (ſaith he) that Ten Foot of earth will drink up all this water? To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="26">26. That in thoſe great and long continued falls of Rain, which cauſe inundations of water, the greater part thereof falling upon hills, champion and high grounds, runs down into Rivulets, and from thence is conveyed into Rivers, which coming ſuddenly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow their banks, drown Marſhes and adjacent low grounds, but preſently after are diſcharged into the Ocean. Now that Rain, which falls upon low Fenny grounds, where the water has not that uſual current into Rivers, either reſtagnates upon the <hi>Superficies,</hi>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:41152:159"/>and cauſeth Marſhes, Lakes, Ditches, Bogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or ſinks into the earth, eſpecially where the cruſt or courſe of earthy Clay, is but thin, before an other <hi>Fundus</hi> of Gravel or Sand appear; for in ſome low mooriſh grounds, the outward <hi>Fundus</hi> or cruſt, is a bituminous ſpongy earth, ſuch are the Turf-Moors into which Rain-water ſinks deep; others are of a more ſtiff Clay or Marle (and thoſe both high and low grounds) which cauſe Rain-water to reſtagnate or lye long upon them.</p>
            <p n="27">27. So that, It's the difference of Soyls, which makes Rain-water either ſink or lye above: where the Soyl is ſandy, the Rain ſinks preſently; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch High-ways are the beſt to Travel in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or Winter-Now (I ſay) ten foot is deep enough to contain all that which remains after the greateſt part is carryed away by Runnels, and divers Currents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rivers, and thoſe again into the Sea; for I have obſerv'd that in two or three days Rain it hath ſcarce ſunk a Graft-depth in our Garden-earth. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we ſhould ſay with Dr. <hi>Wittie,</hi> That by ſome ſecret paſſages into the caverns of the earth, it ſhould ſink much deeper than ten foot: yet we ſhall meet with two difficulties, the ſolving of which, will prove Ominous to the Doctor's Opinion of the Original of Springs. The firſt is, How ſhall rain-water ſink into the earth by empty creviſes or clefts, which I imagine he ſuppoſeth to be at ſome diſtance from each other: Now what is that that muſt bring the intermediate particles of water (which fall between one creviſe or cleft and another) into the diſtant creviſes, He ſhould have done well, to have aſſigned thoſe particular Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before he had determin'd theſe creviſes. I am apt to think he hath grounded his ſuppoſition of theſe creviſes and clefts, from thoſe chinks and clefts in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:41152:159"/>the earth, which he hath ſeen happen in a long drought; as if thoſe were not forc'd by the extream dryneſs of its <hi>Superficies,</hi> and fill'd again upon the acceſs of Rain, when the earth being moiſtened, comes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Rain ſinks no more down thoſe clefts or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, than down any other more ſolid part thereof.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Why might not he rather (and that more truly) ſuppoſe the earth to imbibe Rain-water as a ſponge: where it meeting with capillary veins (as I may call them) or ſmall pores (not clefts or creviſes, which are ſcarce to be found but amongſt Rocks, and Rocky Soyls) ſinks down by degrees into larger veins, and thoſe into Subterraneal Chanels, where it makes Land-Springs, which ſupply many Draw-wells; yea and many of them run into Rivers too, which help to keep Rivers high in Winter time, above the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pitch they are found to be upon droughts.</p>
            <p n="29">29. The next difficulty that ſprings up (which indeed is the moſt conſiderable) is, If Rain-water ſink much deeper than ten foot into the caverns of the earth (as he ſuppoſeth) Then, what ſhall fetch it up again, to make it ſupply Springs that are upon Hills or high Heaths, nay upon the very level of Plains themſelves? For it muſt be a <hi>retrograde</hi> motion of the ſame water, which before deſcended into ſuch low caverns of the earth — <hi>Facilis deſcenſus Averni, Sed revocare gradum ſuperaſque aſcendere ad auras, Hic labor, hoc opus</hi>—</p>
            <p n="30">30. The next Objection he brings out of <hi>Seneca,</hi> and his ſolution, evince no more than what we grant, <hi>viz.</hi> That there may be additional Land-Springs, and that amongſt Rocks, which receive their ſupply from Rain and Snow-water, which upon droughts are dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and therefore are not Quick-Springs, whoſe Original, I ſhall ſhortly hint to be otherwiſe; beſides
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:41152:160"/>he acknowledgeth that in ſolid Clay Soyls, it is very rare to find any eruption of water, becauſe ſuch are ſad earth, and have few or no caverns or chanels in them: but our Springs, Saith he, break out ordinarily in rocky and gravelly ground, eſpecially the beſt and moſt laſting Springs, ſuch as we call <hi>Fontes perennes;</hi> which indeed is moſt certainly true, for they are not found but as accompanyed with a boyling gravel or ſand, called by <hi>Helmont Quellem</hi> or <hi>Sabulum Bulliens,</hi> which makes nothing at all towards the proving his Aſſertion.</p>
            <p n="31">31. The laſt Objection he brings out of <hi>Seneca,</hi> is, That in the dryeſt Soyl, where they dig Pits two or three hundred foot deep, there is often found great plenty of water, which he calls Living-water, as not coming from the Clouds. Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi>'s Solution of which Objection is thus, From whence then ſhould it come? from the Sea? Perhaps (ſaith he) the Sea is as many Miles from that water, as the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi> of the earth is feet from it. Suppoſe it were (ſay I) What might hinder, but that water might be carryed from the Sea, by Subterraneal Chanels, at far greater diſtances than ſo? If Seas communicate with each other (as we ſhall ſhortly endevour to prove) it muſt be by Subterraneal Chanels, many of which muſt be of far greater length.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Perhaps it may come, ſaith the Doctor, from the Tranſmutation of Aer into Water; for ſuch a Tranſmutation, I cannot, ſaith he, deny: ſo that (in ſhort) to me it ſeems as if he hovered between two, whether to aſcribe the Original of Spring-water, to the Tranſmutation of Air into Water, or to Snow and Rain-water; Only he ſaith indeed, It's moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to come from Rain; ſo that, That at the hardeſt and at the long run carries it; yet that of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmutation
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:41152:160"/>of Air into water, is not without its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure; and that he thinks very well confirm'd too, by an inſtance he brings in, which is, We ſee, ſaith he, Churches become wet, before Rain falls, from this cauſe. Why, What is the cauſe? <hi>(viz)</hi> the tranſmutation of Air into Water: and truely, I am apt to believe, that in moyſt weather, as ſure as the Air is tranſmuted into water, which moyſtens the Stone-Walls of buildings, ſo ſure is Air in the Bowels of the Earth, tranſmuted into Water; yea and ſo ſure is the Original of Fountains from Rain, and Snow Water.</p>
            <p n="33">33. I wonder the Doctor's Philoſophy, in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edition, ſhould not come forth more matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, then to adhere to this old, and long ſince exploded tranſmutability of <hi>Elements,</hi> which has no true ſolide <hi>Baſis</hi> to be grounded upon: For if the watryneſs we find, in moyſt weather, upon ſtones of Walls, and Floors of Buildings, be from the tranſmutability of Air into Water; and that he informs us before, that reaſons tells us that more then ten parts of Air, will not ſerve for the making one of Water, I think, ſaith he, twenty would be too little: if ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts (I ſay) of Air, be too little to make one of water, and yet ſo much water is made (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own ſuppoſition) as ſerves to moyſten Stone-Walls, and Floors, in moyſt weather, before rain; then what muſt ſupply the place, and fall into the rear, of ſo much tranſmuted Air: The water thence made is but as onetoten, or twenty, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot ſupply the neceſſary vacancy, becauſe one cannot make up nine, much leſs nineteen: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a horrible vacancy would (if this Doctrine were true) long ere this, have ſurpriſed the body of Air.</p>
            <p n="34">
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:41152:161"/>34. Yea and ſuppoſe we ſhould, with him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the poſſibility of the tranſmutation of Air into Water, in the bowels of the Earth, for the furniſhing of Springs, [for ſuch Tranſmutation (ſaith he) I cannot deny], and keep our proportion of twenty to one: What a vaſt <hi>Vacuum</hi> (long ere this) had the <hi>Mundane Syſteme</hi> groan'd under? Which would have impos'd one of theſe two grand abſurdities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> either the circulation of bodies, one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, (requiſite for the maintaining the unity, and intirenes of the World) would be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, by the great contiguous <hi>Vacuums,</hi> which muſt follow, wanting other bodies, ſo to tear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in pieces, as to ſupply the place of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Air; or elſe, thoſe who live in the laſt Ages, or the longeſt, might have cauſe to fear, leaſt the ſame miſhap might fall to their lot, as happens to thoſe poor Animals, that get into Squire <hi>Boyl</hi>'s Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pump <hi>viz.</hi> to dye of Spaſmes, and Convulſions, through the thinneſs of the Air, which would be ſo interſperſed with contiguous <hi>Vacuums,</hi> made wider yet by the frequent tranſmutation of Air into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that we ſhould not be able to live therein: or laſtly, we ſhould conſtantly be expos'd to the ſame injury, that thoſe are, who travail over the Mountains, call'd <hi>Andes</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> where the Air is ſo thin, and rarified, as they travayl not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of being ſtifled, for want of Air: and therefore uſually they carry Sponges moyſtened with Water, for the condenſing the Air, or the vapours therein; which Air is ſo diſpos'd there to Inflammations, as that Travellers (as the Ingenious <hi>Kircherus</hi> obſerves) ſeeme to belch forth flames, and being all in a ſweat, appear as if incircl'ed with Fire.</p>
            <p n="35">
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:41152:161"/>35. I muſt needs (indeed) grant, that the Air hath its <hi>Vacuolums</hi> or little <hi>Interſtices,</hi> its texture being like a net, or ſpong, by which it becomes the more capable of being as a vehicle, for tranſmitting rarifyed Water, and other vapours of the <hi>Atmoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> becoming thereby, the better Subſervient to the performing the great circulation of water, from the Sea, and Earth, up to the Clouds, and from thence down again, to the Earth: but that the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in the Air, ſhould be reputed Air tranſmuted into Water, <hi>viz:</hi> That which falls upon ſtone-walls in moyſt ſeaſons, is ſo abſurd, as it's enough to confute it to name it: So that we may conclude, that the moyſture in the Air, which ſettles it ſelf upon the Walls, and floors of Stone-buildings, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor ever was Air: and that the tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Air into Water, in the bowels of the Earth, is impoſſible; and laſtly that Springs, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>fontes perennes,</hi> have not their Original from Rain, and Snow.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Thus I have run through the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things which the Doctor offers, in order to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his opinion of Rain, and Snow Water, to be the Original of Quick-ſprings, and all along (I think) have probably (if not demonſtratively) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn'd his Opinion, together with the grounds, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and reaſons thereof. I might (I confeſs) multiply more words, in proſecuting at large, his whole diſcourſe; but ſtudying brevity, I have couch'd all he hath to ſay, that is any way pertinent to his purpoſe; ſaving the ſtory he relates, out of Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> concerning the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, which (without reflection on that worthy Author, who, as well as other Hiſtorians may probably take many things upon truſt) which
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:41152:162"/>I ſay, as to the verity of matter of fact, I ſhould very much ſcruple, <hi>viz.</hi> That a drought ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo long, as thirty ſix years, ſo as all the Springs, Torrents, or Rivers, were dried up; and that in the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great: It's very probable, he had it by Tradition, which many times to wing Fame, makes large plumes. That an Iſland ſo near the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea ſhould want rain, for 36 years together, would certainly put an ordinary credulity upon the Tenter-hooks, and ſtretch a <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> beyond his ordinary pitch; for, of all places, Iſlands are the moſt frequented with Showers: And that it ſhould be done deſignedly by God, upon a miraculous divine account, I do not well underſtand; becauſe that has its ends, and aims, for the puniſhing the Natives, where judgements are brought forth, which done, they frequently ceaſe; but here (according to the ſtory) they were forc'd to forſake the Iſland, and to ſeek for new habitations; ſo that probably it may paſs for a drought in <hi>Utopia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="37">37. And laſtly, the two Rarities, he mentions, that are to be found; upon the Caſtle-Hill in <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough. viz.</hi> the deep Well, which reacheth to the bottom of the rock, which hath no water; and the ſpring-Well, which is within half a yard of the edge of the rock, towards the Sea, which never wants water, which (he ſaith) doth ſomewhat illuſtrate the point in hand: The firſt of which, ſeems (to me) onely to be a Well digg'd, within whoſe compaſs no Chanels have happened, and therefore it is dry; for ſo narrow a compaſs, as a Well is, may ſometimes happen to miſs of ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Chanels. And as for the other, which is ſo neer the edge of the Rock, towards the Sea, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wants Water, I look upon it as ſupply'd from
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:41152:162"/>the ſame cauſe, that other digg'd reſtagnant Wells are, <hi>viz.</hi> from Land-ſprings, which are feed from Rain, or Snow-Water, which yet makes nothing in reality, towards the confirming his <hi>Theſis;</hi> for it is no current Spring, to the beſt of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: which yet ſuppoſe it were, it will not be uneaſy to conceive the manner, and way of its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, when I have propounded what I have to ſay, in order to the eſtabliſhing a new <hi>Theſis,</hi> which will be poſitive to the point in hand.</p>
            <p n="38">38. And that is (as I hinted before) from a circulation of Water, in the <hi>Terraqueous</hi> Globe, by the mediation of Subterraneal Channels along the <hi>Sabulum bulliens,</hi> from Sea to Sea; yea and from the Sea to the Heads of Springs, and from them into Rivulets, and thoſe into Rivers, and thence into the Ocean; and ſo circulates round: which alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes an other circle of Rain, and Snow, which firſt ariſing by exhalation from the Sea, and Earth, is carryed down again, upon the Earth, and Sea; joyning Iſſue with rivulets from Springs, ſwell Rivers, which again diſcharge themſelves into the Sea.</p>
            <p n="39">39. So that a Circulation of water is as juſtly requiſite (according to the order, and appointment of the primitive Cauſe) for the upholding the <hi>Symmetry</hi> of parts, and intirenes of the whole <hi>terraqueous</hi> Globe, as the Cirulation of blood is neceſſary for the preſervation of life, and vital functions in the <hi>Microcoſme</hi> or body of man: The earth can no more produce Vegetables, or Minerals without this connatural circulation, of water repleniſh'd with Celeſtial influences, than the blood in the body of man can produce Vital, or Animal Spirits, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for abſolving the functions of life, without its
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:41152:163"/>inbred circulation: which concatenation of parts, in the circulation thereof, gave cauſe to ſome Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of old, to call the world, a great <hi>Animal;</hi> either becauſe that <hi>animarum omnia plena viz.</hi> that the Seeds of all things are at hand, and at the beck of the primitive <hi>Fiat,</hi> alwayes at work; or becauſe of the great <hi>Symmetry</hi> of parts, or coordinate circulations, of the conſtituent Particles of the World, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions were ſo exact, and actions upon each other, in the circle of nature, ſo uniform, as if actuated by ſome <hi>Panſpermion</hi> or univerſal operative Spirit

Not to ſay, how Analogous the Sea, and <hi>Hydrophylacia,</hi> thoſe great Ciſterns of Water, and Springs of the Deep (that in <hi>Noah's</hi> Food, joyn'd Iſſue with the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of Haven, for drowning the World) are to the heart of the <hi>Microcoſme:</hi> nor how Analogous the Channels of the <hi>Quellem or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum bulliens,</hi> which cary the Waters into the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt circle of the Earth, for the ſupply of Mineral <hi>Glebes,</hi> Minerals themſelves, and Vegetables upon the Green Carpet thereof, are to the Arteries, in the body of man; by which the blood circulates from the Heart, for the nouriſhment of the whole: nor yet to determine the analogy of theſe circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Waters, further drawn up, by Solar exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which clime up the ſlender Threds of Aereal <hi>Syphons</hi> into the <hi>Capitol</hi> of the Air, to be impregnate there with Coeleſtial influences, or Animal ſpirits, (if I may ſo call them) which cohobated upon their own body, promote vegetation, yea and animation too, by becoming that <hi>cibus occultus in aere,</hi> of which, the <hi>Coſmopolite,</hi> and other <hi>Hermetical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> diſcourſe at large: I ſay, not to determine

            <p n="42">42.

The nouriſhment, the blood gives, in the habit of the body, whether carried upwards, or downwards, is the ſame: yea it aſcends (with as quick a motion) as it deſcends, and that becauſe it's carried in its own proper veſſels, and mov'd by the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the heart, whoſe vibration to parts (whether upwards, or downwards,) is equal.</p>
            <p n="43">43.

            <p n="44">44. Now that the <hi>Quellem,</hi> or <hi>Sabulum bulliens</hi> is the proper Conduit, and Subterraneal Channel, for water to circulate in, whilſt in the bowels of the Earth, is hereby apparent, That a true Quick-Spring, never breaks forth, but this ſand alſo appears; yea where ever any dig in the Earth for the ſaid Springs, they are not found, but at the bottom or verge of the <hi>Fundus</hi> of Mineral Earth, Clay, or marly ground, where ſand is alwayes ſeen to break up, with the living Spring, which frequently breaks forth under the Channels, and banks of Rivers (whence it is that plenty of ſand is wrought up in Rivers) alſo in Plains, Valleys, Heaths, Hills, and Mountains, or in any places thereof, digg'd for Springs, are found, (as I ſaid,) ſtore of this Sand.</p>
            <p n="45">45. And that there are Subterraneal Channels, by which Sea's, at great diſtance, communicate with each other, will appear, firſt, if we conſider the Ocean (which is the whole bulk of waters that compaſs the Globe of earth) is but one, which receives different names according to various Regions it waſheth; as <hi>Oceanus Atlanitcus, Germanicus, Deucalidonius, Septentrionalis, Tartaricus, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopicus, Mare Arabicum, Mar di India, Mar Del Nort, Mar Del Zur,</hi> or, <hi>Mare Pacificum, Archipelagus, &amp;c.</hi> And there is no In-land Sea, which receive Rivers, and let none forth viſibly, but they communicate with the Ocean.</p>
            <pb n="307" facs="tcp:41152:165"/>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, is joyn'd to the <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Ocean, <hi>per Fretum Herculeum,</hi> and to the Red-Sea by occult Subterraneal Channels, as the Story (related by <hi>Kircherus</hi>) of the Dolphin firſt taken in the Red, and ſoon after in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea: So the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> by the mediation of Subterraneal Channels is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the <hi>Euxine,</hi> or black-Sea, and this to the <hi>Aegean,</hi> and that to the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> Thus theſe great Seas in <hi>Aſia</hi> communicate with each other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of <hi>Scaliger, Wendeline,</hi> and <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherus:</hi> So the <hi>Baltick</hi> communicates with the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Deucalidonian</hi> Seas by the two Arms, <hi>Boſnicum,</hi> and <hi>Finicum, per Fretum Cymbricum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="46">46. In like manner the <hi>Aſphaltick</hi> Sea or <hi>Mare Mortuum</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> communicates with the Red-Sea, by the ſame Subterraneal Channels, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are conveyed into the Ocean: So the Lake <hi>Zaire</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> by the ſame manner, empties it ſelf into the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Ocean; And that great River in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> call'd <hi>Fluvius Niger,</hi> flowing from the Lake of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and being ſhut up, by a Chain of Mountains, in the Kingdom of <hi>Nubia,</hi> where pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately breaking forth of the Weſtern part of the Mountains, empties it ſelf by Subterraneal <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> where, meeting with ſeveral other Rivers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them, and at length is carried into the <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Ocean: After the ſame manner the River <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> being carried through the Lake <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> meets with reſiſting <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> thruſts down its head, into a large den, and after a great ſpace of ground, peeps up again; where ſcarce paſſing the Lake <hi>Thoſpis,</hi> but it is begirt again with other Mountains, and hides it ſelf again in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Chanels, and breaks forth 24 Miles, on the other ſide of the Mountains, then continues to

            </p>
            <p n="47">47. Now I ſay, that theſe In-land Seas, Lakes, and great Rivers, do communicate with each other, and at length, are carried into the main Ocean; and that this is done by Subterraneal Channels, will be apparent as followeth: Firſt that the <hi>Caſpian</hi> hath intercourſe with the <hi>Euxine,</hi> or black Sea, by ſuch paſſages, is evident; becauſe it receives into its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, a conſtant flux of great Rivers, and lets none forth (viſibly) by any arme into the Sea; and and yet, notwithſtanding, is not at all increaſed; and <hi>Kircher</hi> gueſſeth, that before the deluge, it might be contiguous with the Ocean, overrunning all the Sandy Deſarts of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and afterwards was broke off by the Chain of the Mountains of <hi>Caucaſus.</hi> This is onely conjectural, but however it appears, as if it were a Lake ſhut up on all hands, having Rivers let into it, but none let forth; and yet ſhews no footſtep of inundation, and therefore, muſt of neceſſity, have communication with other Seas by private Chanels. The ſame is alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm'd by obſervation, That has been made upon that Sea (as <hi>Kircher</hi> reports,) by <hi>Paradia Perſa</hi> in <hi>Geograph. viz.</hi> that when ever the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Winds have rul'd ſtrongly over the <hi>Caſpian,</hi> at the ſame time in the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, the boylings has been obſerv'd greater then wonted, with a great agitation of the whole Sea: And on the contrary when the Weſtern Winds blew ſtrongly, upon the <hi>Euxine,</hi> the like perturbations have been ſeen, in the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea; and when the <hi>Caſpian</hi> hath by the agitation of winds, emptied it ſelf into the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine,</hi> it is again repleniſhed by the like ſecret paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sea, which is done by a kind of <hi>Charybdis,</hi> or <hi>Vortex,</hi> along the ſhore of the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:41152:166"/>
               <hi>Sinus Perſicus,</hi> whereby the Sea, ſeems to be (ſometimes) drunk up with a notable decreaſe, which, by a freſh flowing of the Sea, the <hi>Vortex</hi> is hid again: So that the <hi>Caſpian,</hi> by Subterraneal Chanels, receives a ſupply, from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sea, and by the like Chanels communicates, with the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p n="48">48. That the <hi>Asphaltick</hi> or <hi>Mare Mortuum</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates, by the ſame hidden paſſages, with the Red-Sea, is evident, becauſe, upon the coaſts of the Red-Sea, which looks towards the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> at the noted place, call'd <hi>Eltor</hi> (as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive <hi>Kircher</hi> relates) where (not far from the ſhore, from the bowels of the Sea) is found, at ſometimes, great plenty of <hi>Naphtha</hi> and <hi>Bitumen</hi> which comes from the <hi>Bituminous</hi> Sea, call'd <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi> from its <hi>Lentor</hi> or toughneſs; it's call'd alſo <hi>Mare Aſphalticum,</hi> from <hi>Bitumen,</hi> of which it has great plenty; whoſe ſhores have great ſtore of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous</hi> Pits. Into this Sea <hi>Jordan</hi> runs, which having no other way to emptie it ſelf, but by theſe Subterraneal Chanels, carries along with it its <hi>Bituminous</hi> offspring into the Red-Sea, and that by a Chanel of 62 Leagues, for ſo far is the <hi>Aſphal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> from the Red-Sea. The ſame happens to all Seas, Lakes, and great Rivers, which receive others into themſelves, but let none forth by viſible arms, and therfore do it by Subterraneal paſſages.</p>
            <p n="49">49. Other Lakes there are, whoſe <hi>Superficies</hi> lies level with that of the <hi>Hydrophylacia,</hi> and therefore are as Springs of the deep, kept for a reſerve, for the furniſhing (upon occaſion) the grand Circulation: Many other Rivers, beſides what are named, do hide their Chanels in the Earth, for many miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and appear again, as the <hi>Rhine</hi> in <hi>Germany,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:41152:167"/>Padus</hi> in the <hi>Alps:</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Guadiana,</hi> of old call'd <hi>Anas</hi> a River in <hi>Spain</hi> which runs under ground, in a ſubterraneal Chanel, for 32 Miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and breaks up again; which gave occaſion to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to boaſt of their great Bridge, which will feed ſo many thouſand Sheep: alſo the River <hi>Rye</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) runs under ground a quarter of a Mile, and then appears again.</p>
            <p n="50">50. And as by this Circulation of Water, all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Seas, Lakes <hi>&amp;c.</hi> communicate, by Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Chanels, or by viſible arms, one with another, and at length with the common Ocean it ſelf: So by the mediation of the ſame hidden pipes, conveyed along the <hi>Sabulum,</hi> the Water circulates, from the Seas, and <hi>Hydrophylacia</hi> unto the Spring-heads, which breaks forth at great diſtances, either in Levels, Valleys, Hills, or Mountains.</p>
            <p n="51">51. Now to determine the cauſe of the Waters riſing above the Level of the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Sea, up into the tops of Hills, and Mountains, a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeemingly (and indeeed really according to the <hi>Hydroſtatick</hi> Laws of water, conſidered as <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated</hi>) contrary to the nature of the weight of Water, will be here very conſiderable, being the main thing, objected againſt the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of Springs taking their Original from the Sea. To the better underſtanding of which, we ſhall propound.</p>
            <p n="52">52. Firſt that this <hi>Theſis</hi> ſuppoſeth, and has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto partly proved, a Circulation of Waters, or a running round, from the Ocean into In-land Seas, and Lakes, and thoſe into each other, and back again into the Ocean; but whilſt running into each other, they alſo run along other Subterraneal Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, at great diſtances under the Earth, until they

            <p n="53">53. But that we may be the more demonſtrative, I ſhall, for better apprehenſion, determine a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Circulation; and that ſhall be from the Sea, and from the efficient cauſe moving the Seas, which will be the laſt again in the Circle: and this we ſuppoſe to be the Winds, Storms and preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> upon the ſurface of the Seas, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the influence and <hi>Ellipſis</hi> of the Moon, which (probably) gives being to the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux</hi> of the Sea, by cauſing a depreſſion of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, at two oppoſite places in the <hi>Terraqueous</hi> Globe, and an accumulation of the Seas, anſwerable thereto, in the two other <hi>Quadrants</hi> of the Globous Circle; which ſwelling of the Sea, is always oppoſite, each <hi>Tumor</hi> poſſeſſing a whole <hi>Quadrant</hi> of the vaſt Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: theſe Tumors rowl about the earthy Globe in Twenty four hours, thereby agitating the whole bulk of the Seas, and driving up the waters by the Subterraneal Chanels into the <hi>Hydrophyl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="54">54. That there is (beſides the weight of Clouds, Storms, Winds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) a preſſure of Water by Air, is evident in common <hi>Hydroſtatick</hi> Experiments; for if you put down a glaſs-<hi>Tube</hi> into a veſſel of water, you will find the water in the <hi>Tube</hi> to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the level of the water in the veſſel, and that for no other cauſe than that the preſſure of the Air upon
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:41152:168"/>the ſurface of the water in the veſſel, is ſtronger than the reſiſtance of that Ayr that is pent up in the <hi>Tube;</hi> and that it is ſo, is evident, becauſe if you ſtop up the upper end of the <hi>Tube</hi> with your thumb or the like, you will find that the Ayr in the <hi>Tube,</hi> not having the liberty of recoyling, becomes ſtrong, and preſſeth ſo much upon the water, as that it raiſeth up the water in the veſſel to ſuch a height, proportionable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the <hi>Tube;</hi> which I have thus tryed, by taking a pint-white-Viol, fill'd with water to about a fingers breadth of the mouth, into which I let down a glaſs-<hi>Tube,</hi> ſtopping the upper end cloſely with my thumb, the Ayr in the <hi>Tube</hi> would ſo preſs upon the water, as that the glaſs would (in a manner) be quite full: but upon removing my thumb, the water would immediately run up the <hi>Tube,</hi> two or three fingers breadth above the level of the water in the Viol, and bubble up to and again, till it ſettled a little above the ſurface of the water in the Viol: and that ſtill becauſe water follows the ſtrongeſt impulſe of Ayr, which while the <hi>Tube</hi> is cloſely ſtop'd, bears down the water, and raiſeth it on the ſurface thereof; whereas when the Ayr in the <hi>Tube</hi> has liberty again, then the water being preſſed by the Ayr upon the <hi>Superficies</hi> thereof, mounts up ſpeedily above the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of the water in the Viol.</p>
            <p n="55">55. So in like manner we ſee in a Weather-glaſs which is (ſuppoſe) a Globe or Egg-glaſs inverted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a veſſel of water, which if you do, without alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tone of the Ayr in the glaſs, the water ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth very little within the <hi>Tube;</hi> and that becauſe of the reſiſtance that is made by the unaltered Ayr in the glaſs: but if you heat the glaſs, and thereby thin the Ayr, you will find the water to aſcend gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to a conſiderable height, above the level of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:41152:168"/>the water in the veſſel, which ſuppoſe to be done in the foreſaid pint-Viol, and you ſhall ſee the water five or ſix fingers breadth above the ſurface of the water in the Viol: which when cool, ſet it before the fire, or expoſe it to the heat of the Sun (ſo the heat be proportionable) and you will find it deſcend as faſt, as it aſcended before.</p>
            <p n="56">56. Which argues, That Ayr, when altered by heat, gives a different (and that a leſs) preſſure upon the body of water, than when it is in its natural tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore, upon the attenuating of Ayr, by heat, in an inverted oval glaſs, the water ſeems to be drawn up by a kind of <hi>Suction,</hi> as ſome would have it, or to prevent a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> as others think: but moſt probably (if not demonſtratively) it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends gradually, and ſenſibly, for this cauſe <hi>(viz)</hi> That when the Ayr in the glaſs, which before by heat was attenuated, is either by cold reduced into its priſtine form, or having (as ſo thinn'd) but a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid preſſure, is therefore by a more ſtrong <hi>Elaſtick</hi> force of Ayr, upon the ſurface of the water, forc'd up, till it come to ſuch a height as the preſſure of Ayr within, and that without the glaſs, are brought to an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> or equal poyſure; I mean till the ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy power of the Ayr, within and without the glaſs, be of an equal force, and there it ſtands, till the ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy power of the Ayr within the glaſs, by heat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes dilated, and then it forceth down the water in the <hi>Tube,</hi> and makes the water in the Viol riſe higher, proportionable to the degree of the attenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ayr.</p>
            <p n="57">57. That the Ayr receives a conſiderable alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by heat, is further confirm'd, by the experiment of inverting a glaſs <hi>Cucurbit,</hi> over a Candle, faſtened with tallow upon the bottom of a glaſs or earthen Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:41152:169"/>(wherein water is firſt poured, to the height of two or three fingers breadths) where the heat of the Candle doth ſo weaken the ſpring of the Ayr with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Glaſs, that it wanting the help of the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Ayr (always requiſite to the perpetuating the motion of bodyes) which is intercepted by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of water, that in ſtead thereof, the Water it ſelf circulates, being forc'd thereto by the ſpring of the Air, that preſſeth upon it from without, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it riſeth up to a great height of the glaſs-body (as I have ſometime ſeen upon tryal thereof) and puts out the Candle: which Experiment ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to contradict the former of a Weather-glaſs, though in reality it doth not; for although there heat makes it deſcend, but here it makes it aſcend: yet if we conſider, that in that of the Weather-glaſs, the Air in it is firſt thinn'd by heat, before the glaſs be put into water, and therefore when it's condenſed by cold, it draws up the water, or rather, the water is forced by the outward Spring of the Air, and follows it to an <hi>Aequilibrium;</hi> but in this laſt Experiment the glaſs is inverted into water, without any previous alteration of the Air therein: which being to ſupply the motion of a body, <hi>viz.</hi> the burning of the Candle, doth it for a while, but wanting a freſh ſupply from other Air without, to promote the Circulation thereof (always neceſſary for the motion of bodies) the want thereof makes the ſtrong ſpring of the Air upon the ſurface of the water, to force up the water it ſelf, into the glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body: From which Experiments, reſult theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Corollaries, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. That a Circulation of Air, is requiſite for the motion of all bodies; the Candle in the glaſs we ſee extinguiſheth for want thereof, by forcing up the water in lieu of Air.</p>
            <pb n="315" facs="tcp:41152:169"/>
            <p>Secondly. That Air may be attenuated by the heat of the Sun, whereby the ſame portion of Air may be made to extend it ſelf over a larger ſpace, witneſs the heating the glaſs, in the firſt of the two laſt Experiments.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. That this Air thus attenuated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the heat of the Sun, is the reaſon why culinary fire dies or goes out, when the Beams of the Sun are caſt upon it, becauſe they thin the Air, and the Air is the natural Bellows of Fire, which Fire burns according to the intenſeneſs or remiſneſs of the Air.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. That the Air thus thinn'd, makes way for water to aſcend up the ſmall veins thereof, which are like ſo many ſlender <hi>Syphons,</hi> by which it mounts from Earth, Waters and Seas up into the Clouds, for the ſupply of Rain and Snow; which <hi>Syphons,</hi> in droughty hot weather, are moſtwhat at work, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it upward, whereas in moiſt weather, the water deſcends by the ſame <hi>Syphons,</hi> and moiſten the Ground with Dew, and Walls or Floors of Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buildings, in wet Seaſons: ſo that the reputed Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of moiſture by the Sun, for the ſupply of Rain, is no other than this gradual ſteaming up of ſlender <hi>Syphons,</hi> whereby water mounts inſenſibly the uppermoſt part of the <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly. That in great heat of weather many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes happen through the thinneſs of the Air; for the Air in the Lungs, is the Bellows of the vital Fire in the Heart, which if it become attenuated, either through a general heat in the Air (whence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth frequently ſome <hi>Epidemical</hi> Diſeaſe) or through the obſtructions of the Lungs themſelves, whereby the Air, for want of foundneſs of Organs, becomes thinn'd before it come to volatize the Blood, in its
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:41152:170"/>current from the right to the left Ventricle of the Heart, cauſeth <hi>Faintings, Laſſitudes, Candialgia's, Aſthma's, Deliquiums,</hi> and (in Women) <hi>Swoonings, Palpitations,</hi> rouſing up the <hi>Spleen</hi> and <hi>Mother, &amp;c.</hi> yea (in fine) makes the Lamp of Life burn dark and dimly; whereas the Air, by cold, being reduc'd to its priſtine form, and the Lungs freed from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, quickens the vital Ferment, ſharpens the appetite, makes the vital Fire burn clearly, and makes evident, that the Ferments of the ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions are vital; for in cold weather, we find our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites more acuated, our Ferments more vigorous, and the Digeſtions more powerful. But I will not (though I might) here further enlarge to ſhew how the Air in a due order, contributes to the invigorating the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and how much it conduceth in the change thereof, towards the curing Diſeaſes. But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>Sixthly. And (which chiefly concerns our preſent purpoſe) aſſert, That the heat of the Sun, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes (by thinning the Air) towards the circulation of water, from Seas to Springs, and from water upon the earth, to Clouds; For the Sun whilſt he is (ſuppoſe) in the Northern Signs, eſpecially towards the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> caſts his rays pretty powerfully upon thoſe Places, which are within the oblique poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sphere (though not perpendicularly, as it happens to thoſe Places, ſituated under the right poſition of the Sphere, where the <hi>Aequator</hi> cuts the <hi>Horizon</hi> at right Angles) whilſt he is (I ſay) in the Northern Signs, by his heat he thins the Air of thoſe Regions; eſpecially, as thoſe Places fall under the <hi>Meridians,</hi> as ſome Places muſt alwaies do (the Sun in his ſuppoſed Diurnal Circuit, making Twenty four <hi>Meridians</hi>) the Air under theſe <hi>Meridians</hi> (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:41152:170"/>in thoſe places where the Sun is, or inclines to be <hi>Vertical</hi>) being attenuated, makes the Air cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the more ſtrongly towards the other <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants</hi> of the <hi>Terraqueous</hi> Globe, cauſing there a ſtronger preſſure upon the Surface of the Seas; and this muſt be conſtantly done, becauſe the Sun (really, or apparently) is alwayes in motion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Earth, who in his Circuit thins the Air of thoſe Places, which lie moſt directly under his Beams, and ſo makes the Air (as I may ſay) ſplit it ſelf (I mean as to its uniform texture) towards the Poles, where it cauſeth a conſtant preſſure upon the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern and <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, and upon the <hi>Mare del Zur</hi> or <hi>Pacificum,</hi> towards the South; as alſo dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Clouds (whilſt he is Northern) into the South ſide of the <hi>Aequator,</hi> enough almoſt alone to give Being to Springs, by forcing the water along the Subterraneal Chanels, up at great diſtances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Continents.</p>
            <p>Seventhly. That Air, attenuated in one place of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> is as much condenſed in an other part thereof; and what it is deficient of force in that thinn'd part, ſo much more it is of force in the other; ſo as to give a proportionable preſſure, anſwerable to the weakneſs of its Spring elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="58">58. Now the natural preſſure of Water by Air, and of the upper parts of water upon thoſe below, is by perpendicular lines; and that by <hi>Vorticles,</hi> as <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> and after him <hi>Des Cartes</hi> and <hi>Kircher</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: Natural (I ſaid) becauſe accidentally by Winds or Storms, the motion may be oblique; ſo that ſuppoſing the Seas to be at their bottom perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in many places, with Subterraneal Chanels and ſecret <hi>Vortices,</hi> the ſurface of the Sea being preſs'd with Winds, Clouds and Storms, the circulated and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:41152:171"/>condenſed Air (which recoyls from the other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> where the Sun-Beams have attenuated it) together with the oblique moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Flux and Re-flux of the Sea, begins the motion towards the grand Circulation.</p>
            <p n="59">59. For the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Ocean being preſs'd by the foreſaid weight, ſends down its water by Subterraneal Chanels into the <hi>Hydrophylacia</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ciſterns of water, which are the Springs of the Deep, where it not only comes to a level, with the ſurface of the Sea, keeping a <hi>Horizontal</hi> Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel therewith (which any water will do in a <hi>Syphon</hi> or duplicated <hi>Tube;</hi> though unaſſiſted by any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable preſſure of the Air) but alſo, by the force of the preſſure upon the ſurface of the Sea, it is eaſily carried up above the level thereof, into Hills, Mountains and high Heaths, which breaking forth, give Being to Springs and Fountains, which run into many Rivulets and from thoſe into larger Rivers; eſpecially joyning iſſue with Rain and Snow-water, and from Rivers are again carried into the Seas.</p>
            <p n="60">60. That this is a Circulation, whereby water is carried in a round, is apparent, becauſe the Seas being preſſed by the foreſaid natural Cauſes, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, by Subterraneal Chanels, along the <hi>Sabulum bulliens,</hi> breaks forth at Spring-heads, in Valleys, Hills or Mountains, runs along into Rivulets, which, with ſhowers, moiſten the earth, and then carried up again by Aereal <hi>Syphons,</hi> in droughty Seaſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Clouds, makes the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> ponderous, which, together with Winds out of Subterraneal Caverns, and the ſtrong Spring of the Air, recoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the reſt, attenuated by the heat of the Sun, together with the Current of all Rivers into the Sea: All theſe (I ſay) joyntly together, conſpire the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:41152:171"/>of the Seas again, into the heads of Springs; and ſo ſtill more on in a circular motion: and that in order to the ſupplying the grand Concerns of the <hi>Terraqueous</hi> Globe, both for Mineral and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble productions.</p>
            <p n="61">61. That the Air doth preſs, is evident in <hi>Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi> Engines, as that of the Wine-Coopers Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, which will by the meer preſſure upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of Wine from Air, force forth the Liquor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other veſſels; the ſame happens in Pumps, which by forcing forth Air, carry up the water; as alſo if a pair of Bellows be ſo contriv'd, as to be plac'd over a veſſel of water, cloſed up on all ſides, with two Pipes going to the bottom of the veſſel, ſo ordered as whilſt the one Bellows is drawn up, the other falls down with its flap, which, preſſing upon the ſurface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, makes it yield, which finding no other way, will mount up (ſuppoſe two Pipes which are carried into a Ciſtern at a competent diſtance) above the veſſel, which again being let forth by an other Pipe at the oppoſite ſide, falls into a chanel, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it upon a Water-wheel, and gives motion (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) thereto; the <hi>Axis</hi> of which, turns about a ſquare handle, to which is faſtened the handle or pole of the Bellows, poys'd upon a leaver, plac'd equally betwixt the two Bellows: ſo that as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter runs out of the Ciſtern it turns about the wheel, and that moves the Bellows, which preſſing the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the veſſel, forceth it up again into the Ciſtern, and ſo in a round; whereas if it could ſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, that this water which moves the wheel about, ſhould by an other chanel, be conveyed into the top of the water-veſſel, it might give a good probability of finding out (at leaſt fairly hinting) a <hi>Perpetual Motion:</hi> A Type of which may be ſeen in <hi>Kircherus</hi> his <hi>Mundus Subterraneus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="62">
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:41152:172"/>62. So in like manner, the ſurface of the Seas, being preſs'd by the foreſaid cauſes, which joyntly together conſpire its preſſure, as the bellows doth the water in the Veſſel, they force it up along Pipes, or Subterraneal Chanels, to the Head of Springs, and Fountains: Which Pipes, by how much the more they are oblique in their windings, by ſo much the more eaſily, the Water is carried up to the tops of Hills, and high Grounds.</p>
            <p n="63">63. And as the Air, by its own innate Spring, doth preſs, ſo ſometimes it becomes more weighty, by having the burden of Clouds lying and preſſing upon it, which alſo contributes to the former preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the ſurface of the Sea; For we ſee, that when the Clouds are about to diſcharge themſelves in Showers, and that in large drops, that they ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the texture of the Air, as they cauſe a Wind commonly to go before each Shower, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but a <hi>Latio Aeris,</hi> or Motion of the Air, from the preſſure of the Clouds, and the greatneſs of the drops, which compreſs the Air, and bear it down, till it hath made its thorough paſſage to the Earth, whereas, when the Rain comes down in ſmall drops, and thin threds, it paſſeth gently through the <hi>Vehicle</hi> and <hi>Colander</hi> of the Air, without any conſiderable preſſure thereof.</p>

            <p n="65">65. So in like manner, the Air in the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> preffeth by its Spring, ſet on work by the foreſaid cauſes, upon the Surface of the Sea, which lyes in Right-Lines with the <hi>Hydrophylacia,</hi> according to the Line <hi>F, G,</hi> which may repreſent the level-ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, both of the Sea, and ſprings of the deep: Which being preſs'd at <hi>G</hi> towards <hi>I,</hi> raiſeth up the Water, from <hi>F</hi> towards <hi>C,</hi> which repreſents high Hills, and Mountains, where Springs break forth, either at <hi>C,</hi> or <hi>E.</hi> Hence we ſee, that as the Spring of the Air is invigorated, or weakned; ſo its preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon water, is more or leſs.</p>
            <p n="66">66. The ſecond Figure (See the 2 Figure of the Scheme) is the ſame, ſave the <hi>Oval</hi> which it wants, having inſtead thereof, a ſmall <hi>Concha,</hi> where the Air from without has a free preſſure; and that part of the Tube to be larger, and the other part revers'd, to be much ſmaller: which ſuppoſe to be fill'd with Water at <hi>A,</hi> where by the Solitary preſſure of the Air, contain'd within the cavity of the Tabe, made by the Palm of the Hand laid thereon, forceth the Water, which is in the Pipe <hi>A B C.</hi> with a great
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:41152:174"/>ſure, from <hi>F</hi> to <hi>C,</hi> and that too, a great Height above <hi>C:</hi> in the ſame manner the Air in the <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere</hi> being preſſed with Winds, Storms, Clouds, and condenſation thereof, and the like cauſes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, forceth upon the ſurface of the Sea (which with the <hi>Hydrophylacia</hi> are alwayes at an <hi>Aequilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> according to the Line <hi>F G</hi>) beyond the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium F G,</hi> into the <hi>Concha's</hi> of Mountains <hi>E, K, C,</hi> which are much higher then the Mathematical Circle of Water (I mean then that circle of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from which all Lines drawn to the Centre, are equal): So that, ſuppoſing a conſtant preſſure, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>A,</hi> or <hi>G,</hi> which is certainly done at all times by ſome, or all of the foreſaid cauſes, the Water muſt as conſtantly be preſs'd from <hi>F,</hi> to <hi>K,</hi> and <hi>C;</hi> and there as certainly make Springs to break forth: for from the ſame cauſes alwaies at work, the ſame effects are alwaies produc'd.</p>
            <p n="67">67.

To which purpoſe, ſuppoſe the line (See the 3 Figure in the Scheme) <hi>A B</hi> to be the <hi>Semidiameter</hi> of the Earth, 3600 Miles long, which terminates in the line, <hi>D, E,</hi> which cuts the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the <hi>Terraqueous</hi> Globe in the point <hi>B.</hi> Now ſuppoſe the height of the talleſt Mountain, to be <hi>C,</hi> which added to the <hi>Semidiameter</hi> of the Earth, <hi>A, B,</hi> will produce the line <hi>A, C,</hi> which expreſſeth the top of the higheſt Mountain: Therefore as <hi>A, B,</hi> is to <hi>B, C,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Semidiameter</hi> of the Earth, to the higheſt Mountain, ſo is 3600, to 30, with which computing the immenſneſs of the ſurface of the Ocean, preſſed on all hands with the foreſaid cauſes, makes it very eaſie to apprehend, how readily Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be carried from the Seas and <hi>Hydrophylcacia,</hi> to the heads of Springs in the higheſt Mountains.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="70">70. And as this preſſure of the Sea, by the ſaid cauſes, is conſtant, and as conſtantly keeps Springs, and Fountains in flowing upon Mountains, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:41152:176"/>places upon Continents, ſo alſo thereby the <hi>Hydrophylacia</hi> are alwayes kept fill'd, from whence, as from a Store-houſe, the <hi>Alps</hi> comprehended by <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> pour forth ſo many Torrents, and Rivers, which by a perpetual current never have ceaſed, nor never will (as long as the Wheels, and Springs of Nature, are kept at work, by the Great Maſter <hi>Mechanick</hi> of the world) ceaſe to flow: from which Springs of the deep, <hi>Danubius, Rhenus, Moſella, Moſa, Rhodanus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rar, Padus, Ticinus,</hi> together with other ſmaller Rivers, have their ſupply.</p>
            <p n="71">71. Beſides, Some Springs ſeeme to emulate the Flux, and Reflux of the Sea, as that which <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us of, in the <hi>Gades,</hi> which obſerves the motion of the Sea, in ebbing, and flowing: and perhaps that in the Peake of <hi>Derby-ſhire,</hi> may be from the ſame cauſe, which ebs, and flows every 12 hours: And how Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> comes to be ſure, that this laſt (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Spring at <hi>Giggleſwick</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire</hi>) hath no correſpondence with the Sea, he might have done well to have inform'd us, that we might have been as ſure as he.</p>
            <p n="72">72. As for the Spring at <hi>Gliggleſwick,</hi> which ebs, and flows many times a-day, we may (perhaps not unaptly) attain to ſome Foot-ſteps of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, if we remind (what I have already delivered above,) <hi>viz.</hi> that if a glaſs <hi>Tube,</hi> ſtop'd cloſe at the one end with ones Thumb, and the other end let down into a Vial, or other veſſel full of Water: as ſoon as ever the air gets liberty, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the thumb, the Spring of air from without preſſeth up the Water 2, or 3 Finger breadths above the Level of the Water, and bubbles up to and again for a while, then ſettles to its ordinary pitch;
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:41152:176"/>which is an exact reſemblance of the Spring at <hi>Giggleſwick</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
            <p n="73">73, For in theſe Springs, the Air is ſo pent up, by the ſtreightneſs of the Chanels near the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and by the denſeneſs of ſome interpoſing <hi>Glebe</hi> of earth: which may, and doth probably for a time, very much, (though not totally) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the motion of the Air, which hinders the Spring from flowing alwayes to high, (as if the Air had liberty it would) therefore it onely flows at that time, when the preſſure of the Water forceth it through the denſe Earth, and gives thereby liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Air, which before was pent up: for we ſee in all <hi>Hydroſtatick</hi> Experiments, that water fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Air, as well as Air circulates after Water; and that Water alwayes obeys the more ſtrong impulſe of Air, though it be to aſcend to a great height.</p>
            <p n="74">74. Now having run through all the cauſes, and demonſtrated the reaſons of thoſe cauſes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the grand Circulation of Water: it is now time to conſider the final End, Aim, and Intention of the firſt Mover in Nature, who ſets all theſe Wheels, and Springs a going, in the great Clock-work of the World, and who orders all things in Time, Weight, and Meaſure; and that to the end, that one part, and Wheel, may mutually promote the motion of an other, that all the parts, and motions thereof, may joyntly conſpire the good, and intirenes of the whole. But that we may (in ſome few particulars) view the Wiſdom of God, in ordering this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of Water; and that it is not done in vain, but hath its various uſes, and thoſe of larg extent, for the benefit of man, and other Creatures, and that as followeth.</p>
            <p n="75">75. Firſt, Waters, by this great Circulation, are
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41152:177"/>kept from putrefaction, and corruption; motion being to Waters, as it is to the vapours in the Air, <hi>viz.</hi> hinders them from corrupting, and as wind fan the Air from putrid vapours, ſo motion keeps Water from <hi>Stagnating,</hi> and conſequently from putridneſs: and therefore a peice of raw fleſh, laid in a conſtant current of Water, will keep from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting a conſiderable time.</p>
            <p n="76">76 Secondly, In times of drought, when Land-Springs are moſtwhat dryed up, Theſe <hi>viz:</hi> the Springs, Rivulets <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contain'd in the great Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſerve for the uſe of Man, and Cattle; and that in places, at great diſtance from large Rivers: for the Quick-Springs, conſtantly moving in the great Wheel, are never dry, and that by reaſon that, where the cauſe doth perpetuate, the effect muſt do the ſame, but the cauſes as aforeſaid are alwaies at work; therefore Springs (I mean Quick-Springs) muſt never fail, as long as the Fabrick of the World is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the ſame <hi>Fiat,</hi> as at firſt.</p>
            <p n="77">77. Thirdly, By great Rivers, which are made of Rivulets, and Fountains, which in the great Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, run thereinto, we can eaſily paſs from one Place, and Country, into an other; and that by Oaken veſſels, which if the Water, whether in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or Seas, were <hi>Stagnant,</hi> could not move thereon half ſo well: ſo that in Ships, by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea, and Winds, we viſit forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys; and the Merchants Traffique abroad, and that for a general good of Mankind.</p>
            <p n="78">78. Fourthly, By this grand Circulation, all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Springs, for the health of man, are produc'd; For the Water circulating in the bowels of the earth (being preſſed by the foreſaid cauſes) as it meets with various Mineral Earths, and Salts, becomes
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:41152:177"/>impregnated with the Tinctures, or taſts thereof, making ſome ſlight ſolutions of the Mineral juy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into it ſelf, paſſeth on to the head of the next Spring, where breaking forth, makes <hi>Spaws</hi> of different ſorts, as <hi>Vitrioline, Alluminous, Nitrous Salinous, Sulphureous &amp;c,</hi> according to the nature of the mineral <hi>Glebe,</hi> the Water paſſeth through to the Spring-head, whence is the great variety of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</p>
            <p n="79">79. Fifthly, Water by this great Circulation in the bowels of the Earth, being diſpers'd (as I may ſay) by capillary veins, into the whole habit of the earthy body, is coagulated by various Ferments and Specifick Mineral, or Metalline Seeds, into ſuch like Bodyes: For (as we have elſe where demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated) Water is the Material ſubject of all Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and conſequently of Metalline Bodyes; and that it needs onely different Seeds, with their various <hi>Archeal</hi> Ferments, to ſhape it into all ſorts of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, found in <hi>Vulcan's</hi> ſhop, each according to its Seminal difference. For from whence proceeds the great variety of all Stones, Marcaſites, Minerals, Mineral Earths, Metals <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but from Water ſhap'd by Seeds, and Ferments into bodyes under various diſguiſes? Which here, by this grand Circulation, is alwayes at hand, and ready for the Seminal <hi>Faber</hi> or <hi>Vulcan</hi> to work upon.</p>
            <p n="80">80. Sixthly, This circulation, joyning Iſſue with that leſſer one of Rain, and Snow, Impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Coeleſtial influences, doth make the ground fruitful, and makes the <hi>Superficies</hi> thereof, bring forth all manner of Seed: Bearing plants and Trees, according to the kinds of the firſt Seeds, or Seminal Principles, implanted by God therein, at the firſt; and ſo being impregnated with the Salt of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:41152:178"/>the Earth; promotes vegetation upon the green car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet thereof: For when when I view Plants, and Trees, in their Verdure in the Spring or Summer times, methinks, I ſee nothing but Water altered by Seeds, and Ferments, which thereupon (<hi>Proteus</hi> like) puts on various Garbs, and appears in different dieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and to me its as eaſy to apprehend, how Water moved by the foreſaid cauſes, riſeth up into Hills, and Mountains, there breaking forth into Springs, as to conceive, how Water riſeth up into the tops of the higheſt Trees, and there to bud forth into leaves, Fruit, and Seed: or how between the Bark, and bole of the Tree, Water ſhould aſcend up, like as in <hi>Syphons,</hi> and that in ſome Trees, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable alteration of taſt, or conſiſtence, from ſimple diſtill'd Water, ſave a ſleight touch of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal <hi>Odor;</hi> as for inſtance, cut a Vine in <hi>January</hi> or <hi>February,</hi> but eſpecially in <hi>March;</hi> and you ſhall find it weep forth a deal of inſipid Water, at the knots or joynts where it's cut: ſo if you wound a Branch of the <hi>Birch</hi> Tree, or lop the bole thereof, in <hi>March;</hi> if it be done below, near the ground, the <hi>Latex</hi> thence iſſuing, is a mere inſipid Water; but if a Branch, of about 3 Fingers thickneſs, be wounded to the <hi>Semidiameter</hi> thereof, and fill'd with Wooll, it Weeps forth a <hi>Subacid Liquor</hi> in great abundance, inſomuch that in one day, ſuch a wounded Branch, may give 8 or 10 pound of that Liquor: concerning the vertue whereof <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, <hi>Qui in ipſo lithiaſis tormento ſolatur afflictes, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quatuorve cochlearibus aſſumptis, viz.</hi> that it gives help, in the torments of the Stone, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the quantity of three or four ſpoonfulls: which he ſaith, is <hi>Balſumus Lithioiſis merus:</hi> which great quantity of Water, muſt come from the root,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:41152:178"/>and that muſt receive it by its Fibers, from the Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Veins of the earth, carryed thither by the grand Circulation of Water, with its included circle of Rain and Snow, which (the one meeting with the other) becomes the material ſubject of all Plants, Trees, and Fruits of the earth, which earth is onely the <hi>Matrix,</hi> where water becomes coagulated, by the Fracedinous <hi>Odor</hi> thereof, and by the Fermental operation of Seed, into all ſorts of Vegetable <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,</hi> which ſpring up in the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth. Now the Medicinal virtue that this Liquor hath, is from a Ferment which it receives from the Tree, as it paſſeth along the Channels thereof; for the ſame Liquor, weeping from a wound of the bole, near the Earth, hath not that virtue; Therefore it muſt be from a Medicinal Ferment it receives from the Tree above that place: alſo if a <hi>Pompion</hi> be cut (while it's growing) will (as a Friend of mine told me, upon his own triall) run a great deal of a lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Water, which by the heat of the Sun, will be congeal'd into a pulpie ſubſtance: and that becauſe the Water, which comes for the nouriſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hath received a Specifical Ferment from the <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> which if it were intire, would preſently be coagulated for the growth and increaſe thereof, but being let forth by a wound, is at laſt, by the heat of the Sun, coagulated into ſomewhat <hi>Analogous</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: ſo probably <hi>Melons, Cucumers, Hollands Squaſh, &amp;c.</hi> would, if wounded, do the like; for they have great ſtore of Water, which comes for their ſupply, which by the Ferment of the Plants, is eaſily coagulated into the pulpous ſubſtance thereof: ſo the heads of wounded Poppies, weep forth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of Liquor, which condens'd by the Sun, becomes <hi>Opium,</hi> or the heads of the ſame
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:41152:179"/>bruis'd, make <hi>Meconium.</hi> In both which, Water is the material ſubject, which paſſing up the ſecret <hi>Meanders</hi> of that Plant, is by the Ferment thereof (particularly appropriate to that Plant, and its kindes in the ſame family) determin'd into that coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting juyce, of which <hi>Opium</hi> and <hi>Meconium</hi> is made; and ſo of the reſt of Plants, Trees, and Fruits. Thus we ſee how Water (in the great Circulation, taking in the leſſer of Rain, and Snow, which is repleted with a volatile <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt, the one joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iſſue with the other) becomes the Material ſubject of all Vegetable Fruits of the Earth.</p>
            <p n="81">81. Seventhly, And laſtly, The Circulation of Water, paſſing through varieties of Glebes, in the <hi>Meanders</hi> of the Earth, makes different Waters of various uſes for the ſervice of man: as for inſtance ſome Waters will bear Soap, and Yeaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Water; and ſome River-Water better then others: alſo ſome Waters are better, and more peculiar for Bleaching, dying, Waſhing, Brewing, ſalving, boyling of Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than others.</p>
            <p n="82">82. Now the great difference, as to the common uſe of Waters, is betwixt that of Springs, and that of Rivers; for the Rivers are generally ſupply'd from Springs, in the round of our Circulation, yet paſſing along the Surface of the Earth, and ſometime running down Hills and ſteep places in torrents, and mixing with Rain-Water, as it runs along into Rivers, it both may and doth give a conſiderable difference to Waters in Rivers, from the ſame, as running immediately from Springs: and that becauſe it waſheth over ſeveral ſorts, or ſoyls of Earth, as Marle, Limeſtone, Manur'd ground, and the like, where it licks up the <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt, wherewith ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sorts of Earth, are repleted, and by the help of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:41152:179"/>this, becomes <hi>Saponary, viz.</hi> bears Soap well, bears Yeaſt, bleacheth well <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="83">83. Whereas ſimple Quick-Spring Water, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the Colander of the <hi>Sabulum,</hi> is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently drein'd of all the Salts, it had imbib'd in other more <hi>Patent</hi> places of the Earth, and perhaps onely retains a ſmall portion of a minute <hi>Sabulum,</hi> inconſpicuous in Water, but remains viſible after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation thereof, or being little indiſcernable Fragments of ſome Marcaſites, or Stones, which it razeth off, as it runs along: which water (I ſay) being perco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from all Salts, through the ſtrainer of the <hi>Sabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> hath not that <hi>Saponary</hi> property, that River-Water hath; and therefore will neither waſh, bleach, nor bear yeaſt. Beſides, many Land-Springs, which drein through <hi>Nitrous</hi> Earth, empty themſelves, by their proper Chanels, into Rivers: Which alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, upon ſudden falls of Rain, overflow low grounds, and ſo do waſh from thence a <hi>Nitrous,</hi> or <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Salt, which contributes much to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing River-Water more uſeful, for the common inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Waſhing, Bleaching, Brewing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="84">84. For, that which makes Soyls more fertile, makes Waters alſo more uſeful, which is an <hi>Alkalizate</hi> or <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt; For what doth Limeſtone, Manure, Marle <hi>&amp;c.</hi> add to the inriching of Soyls, but either by impregnating the ground with a <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt, or making the Earth to become more Magnetical, to center upon it ſelf the Volatile <hi>Nitrous</hi> Aereal Salt, which floats to and again, in the <hi>Atmoſphere:</hi> whence it is, that the Country-man lets ſome part of his tillage or arable ground, ly fallow every year, on purpoſe that this <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt which circulates in the Air, and is the main wheel of Vegetation, may coagulate it ſelf upon the ground, made fit thereto,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:41152:180"/>by the addition of Limeſtone, Marle, or Manure, and thereby become fitter to bring forth many fold: which if the ground be exhauſted of this Salt, as in a few years, by bringing forth much Corn, it will, then it becomes barren, until it be manur'd by dung, aſhes, limeſtone, or marle, and is laid <hi>fough</hi> or fallow (as the Country-man calls it,) which in the concluſion, impregnates the Soyl again, with a freſh Salt, or ſpirit, whereby it is made fruitful. You are the Salt of the Earth (ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples) which, if it hath loſt it's ſavour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall it be ſalted: So that the Earth hath a Salt which makes it fruitful, and the loſs of that Salt makes it barren and uſeleſs.</p>
            <p n="85">85. As for Lime-ſtone, that contributes to the manuring, and inriching of ground, after a double manner; and that firſt by communicating its <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalizate</hi> Salt (which it hath in it) to the ground, and next (which indeed I think is the cheif) that it becomes as a proper <hi>Magnet,</hi> to attract (if ſuch there be) or center upon it ſelf, the volatile fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt, which floats in the Air: in which I am confirm'd, becauſe the Country-man obſerves, that though it be quench'd already with Water, or Rain, before it be thrown upon the ground, (as moſt frequently it is) yet nevertheleſs, it makes the ground as fruitful, as if it were not; yea Lime, that hath laid long, and that one would think hath had all its Salt waſh'd from it, if it be thrown upon impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd ground, will yet make it fruitful. The ſame will the <hi>Faeces</hi> of Soap-Aſhes do, after all the Salts are waſh'd, both from the Aſhes of <hi>Breccans</hi> or <hi>Brogg</hi> (as they call it) and from the Lime: which is much us'd (where it's to be had) to lay up grounds to fertilize them. And that certainly for no other
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:41152:180"/>cauſe, but that it helps, as a proper <hi>Magnet,</hi> the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous</hi> Salt to ſettle upon that ſoyl: whence it is, that they plow that ground often, thereby expoſing new parts of the Earth to the Air, to become impregnate with the Salt thereof: ſo dung, and aſhes have Salts in them, the one a volatile, the other a fixt, but are both much altered by a Ferment both from the Air, and Earth, before they become tranſmuted into the <hi>Leffas terrae,</hi> or are turn'd into the true fructifying <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt: Alſo Marle doth inrich Soyls two manner of wayes; the one is by having a <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt inherent in it ſelf, as I have found, by imbibing it in diſtill'd Water, Filtering, and Evaporating, where I have had actually a <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt: The next way is, by being as a <hi>Magnet</hi> to the <hi>Nitre</hi> in the Air, to make it ſettle upon that Soyl, where Marle is moſt found; therefore that Soyl which is naturally a Marle, or is (at leaſt) well manur'd therewith; keeps in heart as the Country-man ſaith) the longeſt, and will need little, or no other aſſiſtance, for many years, becauſe its a proper ſort of <hi>earth</hi> for the fructify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſalt</hi> in the <hi>air</hi> to ſettle upon, which makes that <hi>ſoyl</hi> hold fruitful the longer. And from the different diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of ground, in order to the degrees of reception of this <hi>ſalt</hi> in the <hi>air,</hi> the great variety of <hi>ſoyls</hi> proceed.</p>
            <p n="86">86. And from the ſame cauſe, it's very probable that the fertility of <hi>Aegypt</hi> is promoted, by the overflowing of <hi>Nilus,</hi> for Rain-Water doth contain of this Salt, which (as I ſaid before) being carryed over the Country by Winds, are not let down, (ſave what moyſture drills down by the <hi>Syphons</hi> of the Air) till the clouds come to the Mountains of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi> where being let forth in great abundance, they waſh down along with them a <hi>Nitrous</hi> Salt from the Earth of the Mountains, which ſtill adds to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:41152:181"/>the fertility of the ground; and that the Air, at that time, hath plenty of this Nitre in it, is found, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if a turfe be digg'd up from the ground (as they uſually do, to know the height of the floud) and weigh'd, they do find it to increaſe conſiderably, as the Water doth in height, with a moyſture, which is impregnate with a Nitrous Salt: For the Earth of that Country is very <hi>Magnetical,</hi> and therefore is fertile, without ſhowers falling immediately thereon and in lieu thereof, hath plenty of dews (which commonly has the greateſt quantity of the fructifying Salt in them) and the flowing of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is ſtrongly impregnated with this Nitrous Salt, from which much Nitre is made, and brought into theſe Northern parts.</p>
            <p n="87">87. Yea, all the great difference of natural Soyls, (for ſome far exceed others in fruitfulneſs) ſeems to depend upom this very hing, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally more replete with, or at leaſt, are more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical of the Nitrous Salt, then others.</p>
            <p n="88">88. Thus we ſee, that it's a Nitrous Salt, that both fertilizeth Earth, as alſo maketh River-Water ſerviceable for the foreſaid uſes: for as it diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Earths, as to their fruitfulneſs, ſo likewiſe it makes the difference betwixt River and Spring-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and that it doth ſo, I am confirm'd by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment I tryed, for my better information therein <hi>viz.</hi> I took of a Well-Water in my own ground, which is ſupply'd by a true Quick-Spring (though it never runs over, becauſe in our greateſt droughts, it is never nere dry) I took (I ſay) a gallon or more of this Water (which alone never bears Soap,) in which I caus'd two dragmes of Nitre to be put, over night: which heated the next morning, I ordered the Maid to put ſome of the uſual Soap thereto, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:41152:181"/>to waſh me ſome linnen therein, which ſhe did, and it made a very good Lather (as they call it) and was as fit for the purpoſe (and perhaps better) then if ſhe had taken ſo much River-Water: The like (I ſuppoſe) Spring-Water would do, if it were ſuffered to run through a Tub fill'd with Earth: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if that Earth hath not been too much exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of its Nitre, by previous Vegetation.</p>
            <p n="89">89.

[But firſt he evaporated 40 Ounces of the Hot Spring-Water, and 5 was left of a ſlimy matter, which being further examin'd, gave three Ounces of a Sweet, and fuſil Salt; the reſt was a ſlimy fat mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which by Fire, ſhewes it ſelf to be of a Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Nature] after digging as aforeſaid, he found the Original of the hot Spring, by obſerving a very great ebullition with much froth: who, to ſearch yet further, digg'd on for three hours along the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the ſame Spring, and found the Water beyond it to be very cold, which was the Current of the ſame Spring, and had loſt both it's taſt, and heat.</p>
            <p>wherefore he took a part of that hot Earth, which ſeem'd to give heat to that Spring, and alſo ſome of the Water, in the very ſource, tryed them both, found the Earth to be a pure ſimple <hi>Minera</hi> of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> and found the water to be impregnated with a Salt, which he calls (for want of an other name) <hi>Sal Hermeticum,</hi> by which, it was manifeſt that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or ſalt contained in that water, by penetrating the ſubſtance of that ſulphureous earth, was the cauſe of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:41152:184"/>the great Ebullition: which is the ſame as in pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water upon <hi>calx vive,</hi> or in making <hi>Tartaruns vitriolatum.</hi> But, to be further ſatisfied, he ordered the Labourers to dig 12 days longer; and found the current to be clear, and ſweet, like ordinary Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Water: but the Earth to be Salt in taſt, with which the current of water was impregnated; and therefore he examin'd the Earth, by infuſing it in Rain-Water, decauting off the clear as it was ſettled: the one half whereof he boyled up in a Copper Veſſel, the other part he diſtill'd in a Glaſs-<hi>Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi> to try whether way would yield the more Salt: and found much leſs, both as to quantity, and quality, in that done in the Copper-Veſſel, than in that diſtill'd in the Glaſs-body. Then he infus'd this Earth again in the ſame Rain-Water, and found a Salt of the ſame nature as before, but leſs in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: which extraction he repeated a third time, but found no Salt at the laſt. The earth therefore he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Air, and found after a time, it was impregnated with the ſame Salt; which Salt being ſeparated, and the Earth become inſipid, upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expos'd to the Air again, was freſhly impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the ſame Salt; which he did alſo a third time <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the like effect: by which he gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, that which renew'd the <hi>Terra mortua</hi> (as he calls it) was the <hi>Spiritus Univerſalis</hi> or <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> or, as I ſaid, the volatile nitrous Salt, which is to be found both in the Earth, and the <hi>Atmosphere.</hi> Which experiment, though it ſhould have been inſerted in our diſcourſe of hot Springs: yet is not very impertinent in this place; becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this digging they found no bottom, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring it ſelf: and was the ſame cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent whether cold, or hot; whether ſaturate with

Thoſe be 1. <hi>Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> or ſolutive: 2. <hi>Cordial</hi> or expelling of Wind: 3. <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> or <hi>Sweating.</hi> The firſt I call <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick</hi> Pills, or Pills proper againſt the <hi>Scurvy</hi> 2. The
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:41152:186"/>ſecond is call'd <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> or <hi>Cordial Elixir</hi> 3. The third I call <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> or <hi>Sweating Pills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three Preparations are compos'd of the beſt, and moſt uſeful Vegetables. The <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> and Salts, wherewith they are extracted, are graduated to the higheſt pitch they are well capable of, <hi>viz.</hi> by Digeſtions, Circulations, and Diſtillations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exquiſitely depurated from all <hi>Phlegms,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogene Faeces:</hi> The very Salts, and <hi>Meuſtrnums,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alone, are Midicines of no inferiour order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſterſive, and aperient of the Veſſels: but further, They alſo open the bodyes of Noble Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getals; and being impregnate with their additional virtues, become very conſiderable helps to nature, to proſcribe what is noxious, and comberſome to the digeſtions (which is the cauſe of flatulencies, or Winds) and to fortify, and ſtrengthen the vital Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in their functions for the health of the body.</p>
               <p>The operation of theſe three Medicines are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, ſafe and harmleſs, as I have found them, by frequent, and conſtant experience; and not onely ſo, but alſo I have found them very ſuccesful, in order to the cure of diſeaſes: with which three, rightly prepared, I had rather chuſe to manage a practice, than with ſo many ſcore of the vulgarly prepar'd ſhop-Medicines, whoſe larg portions, and Farraginous mixtures, rather oppreſs, and nauſeate the digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than give any laudable help, in the proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing that which is noxious, or ſtrengthening to the vital powers.</p>
               <p>And firſt, as to the <hi>Scorbutick,</hi> or <hi>Cathartick</hi> Pills which are proper againſt the <hi>Scurvy:</hi> That being a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe which though at its full ſtate, it vitiates the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:41152:186"/>ultimate digeſtion, and whole habit of the body, with its various Symptoms; yet (as you may ſee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in our diſcourſe of Diſeaſes) the firſt Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries thereof are laid in the Stomach <hi>(viz)</hi> in the error of its Ferment, which by ſome recremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Faeces</hi> being clogg'd, and hindred from making a thorough digeſtion of the alimentary Juyce, laies a foundation for the vitiating the ſubſequent digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For as the Ferment becomes clogg'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by weak, the more <hi>Sordes</hi> are every day heap'd up in the Tunicles of the Stomach, which doth ſtill add to the debilitating the Specifical Ferment thereof; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which, conduceth the plentiful drinking of Ale: and that often not thoroughly fermented, or wrought but thick, and muddy, which leaves abundance of dreggs upon the Stomach, dinting and dulling the Ferment thereof. Alſo the great uſe, of late, of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, both in Sweet meats, Drinks, and Sauces, do not a little clog the Ferment, and add to this diſeaſe; ſo the eating of Salt-meat, and Rye-bread, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an <hi>Aliennted</hi> ſouriſh Ferment therein, which not being <hi>Similar,</hi> to the Acid Ferment of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, begets flatulencies, and leaves much <hi>Sordes,</hi> eſpecially to weak Stomachs to which diſeaſe, alſo the plentiful feeding upon varieties of Diſhes, and the too often eating, and drinking, between meals, before one part be digeſted, and carried off, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part is freſhly thrown down: which ſometimes, makes that part of the nutritive Juyce, which ſhould have paſſed forth, ſtay longer than of right it ſhould, and thereby become too much Fermented, which over-acidneſs thereof paſſeth uncorrected into the ſecond or third digeſtion, and ſo vitiates the blood therewith: which alſo, in the Fabrick of the Animal Spirits, vitiates that prolifique offſpring:
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:41152:187"/>whence proceed <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Palſies, and Apoplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we frequently find, that thoſe who indulge their appetites too much (as many do, who make it moſt of their buſineſs to eat, and drink at all times of the day) as alſo thoſe who foſter, and debauch their Stomachs with ſtrong cawdles, are the moſt apt to have this diſeaſe of the Scurvy, and it various Symptoms, creep upon them; and after all this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging of their appetites, with plentiful variety of food, many add to that, idleneſs, or want of exerciſe: the want of which, in the midſt of plentiful feeding is the ſpeedy way to bring this diſeaſe, and that accompanied with <hi>Aſthma's</hi> or ſhortneſs of breath, with which we ſee many (who are addicted to ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary lives, and yet feed high) are very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, which I may properly call, a <hi>Scorbutick Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> Upon this account of the depravation of the Ferment of the Stomach, whoſe error is continued down to the following digeſtions, thereby levening it ſelf with the whole maſs of humours of the body, this diſeaſe of the <hi>Scurvy</hi> (with an inſeparable <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or wind of the Stomach, and blood) diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelf under the mask of moſt diſeaſes, and appears complicated therewith: ſo that, there are few diſeaſes, whoſe <hi>Seminals</hi> are not <hi>Identical,</hi> with that of the <hi>Scurvy.</hi> Therefore, that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the curing or preventing the Scurvy is alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the curing or preventing other diſeaſes, that depend thereon, whoſe <hi>Baſes</hi> are much what the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the depravation of the <hi>Stomachical</hi> Ferment.</p>
               <p>In order therefore to the aſſiſtance againſt the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſo <hi>Epidemical</hi> a diſeaſe as the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> which creeps inſenſibly from the foreſaid cauſes, upon moſt men, and women, I compoſe theſe <hi>Scorbutick</hi>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:41152:187"/>Pills, whoſe operation is to purge gently, thereby to carry off from the Stomach, and other <hi>Officines</hi> of the digeſtions, the <hi>Stagnant Recremental Sordes,</hi> which are apt to ſettle, as reſidences of the Food we take in; and that, many times, for want of a pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating volatizing Ferment, which ſhould, after digeſtion, leave no <hi>Faeces</hi> or <hi>Caput Mort</hi> behind: for with ſuch volatizing Ferments, ſtrong conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are endued; the conſtitution being moſt what to be computed from the natural vigour, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Ferments (which are the Authors of all Tranſmutations of Food from one taſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to an other, in the whole circuit of the body.)</p>
               <p>Theſe Pills (I ſay) taken at due ſeaſons, help nature to carry off that, which is every day precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the bottom and ſides of the Stomach, which is a kind of <hi>Tartar</hi> or ſlimy ſediment of our meat and drink, not volatiz'd by the Ferment, which day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſing, doth ſtill more, and more, dull, and dead the foreſaid Ferment: But if by ſuch help, as theſe Pills, or other direct courſes, the digeſtions be reminded of their due ſeparations, then theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous precipitations, may probably be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the diſeaſes, thence ſpringing, (whether ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Scurvy, or others complicated therewith) be anticipated: for theſe <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pills are ſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with noble vegetal Extractions, by a depurated <hi>Menſtruum</hi> and generous Salt, as that they not only are gently ſolutive and abſterſive of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Sordes,</hi> but alſo are (withal) reſtaurative (by their Balſamick Ingredients) of the lapſing Ferments; and that firſt by taking off the weights that oppreſs, and load, and next by inciting them to a vigorous activity; eſpecially if ſeconded by
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:41152:188"/>perance in meat, drink, and excerciſe; together with a Doſe (ſometimes) of our <hi>Cordial Elixir:</hi> which, taken after a previous abſterſion, by the <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pills, proves the more effectual in recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Ferment of the Stomach, and in diſcuſſing of Wind, which proceeds from the reluctancy of the Ferment to the <hi>recremental Sordes,</hi> and therein proves a great Cordial, if rightly prepared. For indeed, to ſpeak properly, nothing can truly be call'd Cordial, which doth not allay this <hi>Flatus,</hi> or wind, by taking away the cauſe thereof (at leaſt mitigating).</p>
               <p>Theſe Pills alſo are proper for Dropſical bodies, by making gentle evacuations: for ſuch remedies as are abſterſive, and diuretick, and withal have a reſtaurative aſtringency, communicable to the debilitated <hi>Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> Parts, reducing them to their proper tone, are the moſt proper in Dropſical maladies: Of which ſort are theſe Pills; for they are not onely abſterſive, but alſo by their included eſſential Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> are not a little <hi>Diuretical,</hi> and by its reſtaurative Ingredients, gives a gentle aſtringency to the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous</hi> Parts, promoting the proper tone thereof in their due <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> To which alſo ſhould be added the uſe of our <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the bowels, and Ferments thereof; not that I ſay, theſe will cure a confirmed Dropſye, where the very <hi>Omentum,</hi> or kel, and <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> are become pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid, and rotten, through the long <hi>Stagnation</hi> of the extravaſated liquor: in which caſe I queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nobleſt Chymical <hi>Arcana, viz.</hi> the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Diaphoreticus Fixus,</hi> or <hi>Precipiolum Paracelſi,</hi> would effect the Cure.</p>
               <p>In Hectick Fevers, and incipient conſumptions, theſe <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pills are alſo effectual (being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a ſomewhat leſs quantity than in the other
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:41152:188"/>Caſes) for beſides their moderate abſterſion (by Vegetable Salts) of excremental <hi>Sordes</hi> (which otherwiſe oppreſs the digeſtions) they hinder the reſolution of the compage of the blood, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, in thoſe caſes, is apt to ſhew it ſelf by faint ſweatings, arguing thereby a Solution of the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> of the blood: But by ſome Balſamick, and gently aſtringent Ingredients therein, the <hi>Retrograd Analyſis</hi> of the maſs of blood is prevented: in which caſe theſe Pills are well ſeconded, by ſome Doſes of the <hi>Elixir Propietatis,</hi> taken every other Morning, faſting, two hours after, and the Pills alſo to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken every other Morning, two or three at a time, according to directions given afterwards.</p>
               <p>Theſe Pills are alſo proper againſt <hi>Hypochondriack Melancholy,</hi> by keeping the body ſoluble, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome <hi>Sordes,</hi> whoſe reluctancy (as I ſaid) with the Ferments either of the Stomach, or Splene, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets that <hi>Hypochondriack</hi> Wind, which frisks to and again, and floats round all, or moſt parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and ſuch perſons, commonly feel themſelves moſt at eaſe, and free from the cumber of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring <hi>Flatus,</hi> when their bodies are moſt ſoluble. To a further aſſiſtance wherein, the frequent taking of <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> contributes not a little, by helping to compoſe the otherwiſe irregular <hi>Flatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, in all diſeaſes that are <hi>Symptomatical,</hi> or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary to the Scurvy, theſe Pills are helpful, as in <hi>Scorbutical Palſies, Apoplexies, Aſthma's &amp;c.</hi> which depend upon the prevalency of the <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Flatus</hi> thence iſſuing. The like ſucceſs they have alſo upon <hi>Colicks, Diarrhea's</hi> or Looſneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and <hi>Dyſenteries</hi> or bloody Fluxes; eſpecially if ſeconded with ſome Doſes of the <hi>Elixir Proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> and ſweating Pills.</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:41152:189"/>
               <p>Further as to Fevers, whether intermitting, or continued (ſo they be not malignant,) <hi>viz.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Quotidians, Tertians, Quartanes,</hi> or <hi>Acute</hi> continued Fevers, theſe Pills are very helpful; firſt by abſterſing the recremental <hi>Sordes,</hi> which adhere to the veſſels, and while they are there, they promote the feveriſh fermentation of the blood, and humours: for that the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the blood, and humours, have an immediate dependance, upon the <hi>Regimen</hi> of the Stomach, and <hi>Regent</hi> Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is apparent in the <hi>Febris Ephemeris,</hi> or ſudden <hi>Febricula,</hi> which happens from a diſorder of the Ferment of the Stomach, not being able to ſubjugate the in taken food, which cauſeth a perfect Fever, in all its Symptoms, till the digeſtion be either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, or the deprav'd maſs be thrown up out of the Stomach by vomit; which done, that ſort of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſeth: ſo that the <hi>Minera</hi> of a Fever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intermittent, or continued, yea even of all, or moſt diſeaſes, is radically in the Stomach, after whoſe pipe (as I may ſay) all the reſt of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of other parts, dance, and are really ſubject to the beck, and influence thereof. And that Fevers do much depend upon the <hi>Regimen</hi> of the Stomack, is evident from the frequent vomitings, pains in the head, and back, thence proceeding; as alſo from the ſtrong preſſing thriſt therein: and is more manifeſt, becauſe, if while the blood boyls ſtrongly, by a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Fermentation, a good medicine be given, while it is yet in the Stomach, the blood ceaſeth from its ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fermentation, and perhaps onely breaths forth in a gentle moyſture, the Pains ceaſe, the thirſt is quench'd, and all is at eaſe and quiet for a while. So that in truth, Fevers are but ſecondary in the blood, and humours, but primarily in the Stomach;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:41152:189"/>to which alſo, all Medicines primarily are to be level'd. I ſay therefore, as theſe Pills work upon ſome of the deprav'd matter (which lyeth heavily, as long as it is unvolatiz'd by the Ferment) of the Stomach, by their ſolutive property, and irritating the <hi>Syſtole,</hi> or compreſſion thereof, (vulgarly call'd the <hi>Expulſive Faculty</hi>) together with the orderly <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> carries of part of that recrement, which otherwiſe yeilds fuel to the feveriſh fire, and promotes the <hi>Febrile</hi> Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the whole maſs of <hi>Liquids</hi> in the body: ſo that theſe, by their gently purging quality, leſſen the <hi>Alkalizate Sordes</hi> which cauſe thirſt, and feveriſh burnings, and boylings in the blood; and beſides by their <hi>Menſtrual</hi> Salts, blunt the acrimony of the ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fermentation of the Stomach, and with the help of <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> (which I call the <hi>Cordial Elixir</hi>) taken as I ſhall ſhew afterwards, the cauſe of the feveriſh <hi>Flatus,</hi> will be much abated, which <hi>Flatus</hi> is the neceſſary concomitant, and reſult of the ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feveriſh fermentation in the Stomach, from which incoercible <hi>Flatus,</hi> or <hi>Spiritus Sylveſtris,</hi> all thoſe uſual ſick and faint fits, proceed.</p>
               <p>And if, upon a previous vomit, which, skilfully ordered, leſſons theſe <hi>Alkalizate</hi> burnt <hi>Sordes,</hi> which ſometimes lie faſt riveted in the tunicles and fouldings of the Stomach, theſe Pills be afterwards given, two or three dayes together, and a Doſe of the <hi>Cordial Elixir,</hi> be given in the afternoon, about 3 or 4 by the Clock, as alſo laſt at Night; one of our <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> Pills, with a glaſs of burnt Wine after it, will ſo blunt the acrimony of thoſe burnt recrementall <hi>Sordes</hi> (the <hi>Minera</hi> of the Fever) as that the feveriſh Fermentation will be abated, the cauſe of the <hi>Flatus</hi> (whence ſick fits) will be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:41152:190"/>the boyling Spirits will be ſettled: The <hi>Archeus,</hi> or regent ſpirit of the digeſtions (that <hi>Spiritus impetum faciens</hi>) will be compoſed, and all the clutter will be huſh'd into a ſilent calmneſs, with a gentle breathing ſweat: which <hi>Diaphoretick,</hi> or ſweating Pills are but to be taken every other, or every third night; and that too after a previous eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation either by our <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pills, or at leaſt by a <hi>Clyſter</hi> ordered that afternoon, before they be taken.</p>
               <p>Thus the cauſes being removed, the Fever will begin to decline <hi>(niſi mors ſit in ollâ)</hi> unleſs death be at hand, not but that the diſeaſe will rally up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but with leſs force: then you muſt ſtill repeat the Method of your ſolutive pills in the morning, and <hi>Cordial Elixir</hi> in the afternoon, and ſweating Pill at night, which laſt (when repeated) let al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be done that night, after the ſolutive Pills has been before taken in the morning. Thus you will, by the Bleſſing of God, find a conſiderable abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the violent Symptoms of a Fever, in a very ſmall time.</p>
               <p>And as in continued, ſo alſo in intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whether <hi>Quotidians, Tertians,</hi> or <hi>Quartans,</hi> the ſame <hi>Ternary</hi> of Medicines, are of great uſe and benefit: and that thus <hi>(viz)</hi> by taking (the day before the fit) 2 or 3 of the <hi>Scorbutick</hi> or <hi>Cathartick</hi> Pills, and the night after, a Doſe of the <hi>Cordial Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir</hi> at bed-time, and then (that day the fit comes) to take one or two of the <hi>Diaphoretick,</hi> or ſweating Pills, two or three hours before the uſually expected time, drinking a draught of hot drink after, as of Mace-ale, Poſſet-drink, or Burnt-Wine, and to indeavour, with one covering more than ordinary, to fall into a gentle breathing Sweat, which theſe
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:41152:190"/>will readily procure: And during the time of the Patients ſweating, he or ſhe is to take nothing but hot drink as aforeſaid, and to lye in bed (if the fit come on the day time) till the next morning; and then to renew the taking of the <hi>Cathartick</hi> Pills, and <hi>Elixir,</hi> as alſo an other of the ſweating Pills, before the next expected fit, according to former directions: and by this means, the Patient will find ready help, ſooner in a <hi>Quotidian</hi> or <hi>Tertian,</hi> than in a <hi>Quartaine,</hi> that being ſeated more deeply, in the radical Ferment of the Stomach, and Splene. Theſe as well as continued Fevers (if not all diſeaſes) are radically begotten in the Stomach: primarily there, and ſecondarily, or Symptomatically in other remote parts, to whoſe <hi>Regimen</hi> this <hi>Ternary</hi> of Medicines is cheifly made to correſpond.</p>
               <p>For the general <hi>Indication</hi> of moſt diſeaſes, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to three; and thoſe are, firſt, a <hi>Recremental Faeces</hi> or deprav'd humour, from the error of the Ferments, both of the Stomach, and other digeſtions: I ſay, the abſterſion of theſe degenerate <hi>Faeces</hi> in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral digeſtions, is the firſt, and cheif <hi>Indication</hi> in moſt diſeaſes: The ſecond is a <hi>Flatus,</hi> or Wind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred between the reluctancy of the Ferment, and the foreſaid <hi>Sordes,</hi> which conſtantly begets (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degrees thereof) a freſh ſupply of an inbred <hi>Flatus,</hi> or Wind, the Author of many Pains, diſturbances, in the vital occonomy, and thence Sickneſſes. I ſay, the quieting, or allaying the Wind, by curing, or preventing the the true cauſe thereof, is the ſecond main <hi>Indication</hi> requiſite, in the Cure of moſt diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt is an acrimonious acidity, with a ſpurious. <hi>Latex,</hi> in the intermediate Juyces, and Liquor of the Blood, and <hi>Genus Nervoſvm,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:41152:191"/>Seminals are deſum'd, from an error of the Ferment of the Stomachical digeſtion. The correcting which acrimony, and reduction of the blood to its genuine, Sweet, Balſamick <hi>Eucraſia,</hi> is the third Indication requiſite to be performed, in the Cure of many diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The general ignorance of this <hi>Ternary</hi> of Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among ſome Phyſicians, doting (in lien thereof) on the quaternary of fictitious humours and the like number of external barren qualities, by which they groap'd (as in the dark) after the heat and cold, drineſs, and moyſture of diſeaſes, and ordering their medicines accordingly, hath been no ſmall <hi>Remora,</hi> in the improvement of this noble ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Phyſick: which (through the <hi>Tacite</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, to the <hi>Galenical</hi> preſcripts, by moſt Phyſicians) hath thereby long been kept in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but now at length (by the ſons of art) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more manifeſt, and are expos'd to open view.</p>
               <p>To which triplicity of Indications, this <hi>Ternary</hi> of Medicines are cheifly, and primarily adapted: For firſt, the <hi>Scorbutick</hi> or <hi>Cathartick</hi> Pills are ordered for the carrying off thoſe <hi>Recremental Faeces,</hi> which are begotten through the depravation of the Ferment of the Stomach, and other digeſtions, which give Beginning, and layes the foundation of moſt diſeaſes: Secondly, the <hi>Cordial Elixir</hi> appeaſeth, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Flatus,</hi> or wind, begotten from the reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Ferment, and corrupt matter oppreſſing it; and therefore it is proper for thoſe diſeaſes, where Wind is moſt predominant, <hi>viz.</hi> in thoſe diſeaſes where the Ferments are moſt weakened; for where the Stomach in its Ferment is moſt debilitated, there Wind is moſt prevalent: And thirdly; the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphoretick,</hi> or ſweating Pills, dint, and correct the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:41152:191"/>acrimonious acidity of the ſecondary digeſtions, and liquor of the blood, and of the <hi>Genus Nervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> and carry it off, with the ſpurious <hi>Latex,</hi> in gentle breathing ſweats; and therefore it is proper in all diſeaſes which depend thereon, as in Fevers, Colicks, Defluxions of rheume, dyſenteries or bloody Fluxes, and pains of all ſorts, in all places of the body.</p>
               <p>Now as to the <hi>Cordial Elixir,</hi> whoſe prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is with a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> impregnated with vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſſential Salts, and is either red or white accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Helmont's</hi> proceſs: (and not with Mineral acidities (according to <hi>Crollius</hi>) who falſly reports <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> to be made, with the addition of <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Sulphur</hi>) beſides its uſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, as an auxiliary to the <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pills in the cure of many diſeaſes: it is alſo exquiſitely proper for moſt diſeaſes in women; and that whether the diſeaſe be from the Splene, <hi>Matrix</hi> or mother, or <hi>Genus Nervoſum:</hi> yea, if I ſhould comprize all theſe in one, and ſay from the Stomach, and its <hi>Regimen</hi> upon all the parts at the remoteſt diſtance, I ſhould not (I think) much ſay amiſs: For otherwiſe, why doth a proper remedy while yet in the Stomach, give help to other parts, as for example to the Splene, <hi>Matrix, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Nervoſum &amp;c.</hi> not, but that the <hi>Matrix</hi> hath a proper <hi>Regimen</hi> of its own, which being diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, puts the Stomach, and other parts (by the Links of the <hi>Animal</hi> Chain) out of order.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Elixir</hi> (I ſay) gives help to moſt diſeaſes incident to women, whether with Child, or not; for it appeaſeth Wind very much, which accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt diſeaſes women are troubled with: It is a very good remedy againſt fits of the mother, which is an incoercible <hi>Flatus,</hi> or Wind, ariſing from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:41152:192"/>between the recremental <hi>Faeces</hi> of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi> and <hi>Archeus,</hi> (or <hi>Spiritus impetum faciens</hi>) thereof, eſpecially if taken after a gentle evacuation made by our <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pills, which may be done very ſafely to women breeding or with Child, as I have further treated, in my <hi>Hydrologia Chymica.</hi> To both, <hi>(viz)</hi> to women breeding; and to others with Child, I have given the like, yea ſtronger pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and that did its work not onely innocently, but alſo with good ſucceſs, both to the woman, and Child; and that too, not without very good reaſon: For whence is it, that women frequently (during the whole time of their breeding, and being with Child) are ſo tormented with Pains, Vomitings, Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, Faintneſs, Sickneſs, and the like; but cheifly from a great foulneſs of the Stomach, and plenty of recremental <hi>Sordes</hi> heap'd in the Womb (and that from cauſes not pertinent here to ſpeak of) which often procure feveriſh Fermentations, in the Blood, gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, weakneſs of the Back, illneſs, faintneſs of the Stomack: and by any ſudden paſſion of the mind, rouſeth up the Splene, and Mother, to the great diſcompoſure of the whole fabrick of the body.</p>
               <p>Now what is more pitiful, than to ſee miſerable women, groaning under the weight of theſe real diſeaſes, while they are with Child; and under that colour of being ſo, they fancy to themſelves, they are to take nothing of Phyſick for their aſſiſtance, leaſt they harm the Child: and ſo willingly languiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſtempers that might eaſily be helped, and they themſelves live more cheerfuly, and bring forth the Child more livelily; For if they take ſometimes 1 or 2 of theſe gently purging pills, over night, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the morning (onely taking ſome broth at noon,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:41152:192"/>and eat a little warm meat, without any further trouble) to keep their body open, carrying off thereby, the droſs which oppreſſeth the Stomach, cauſing wind, ſickneſs, and faintneſs, and withall if they take often of the <hi>Cordial Elixir,</hi> according to following directions, they would (I ſay) find them ſelves more healthful, and cheerful, and might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be inabled (through the bleſſing of God) to bring forth with more ſtrength; and that, not onely for their own good, but alſo thus doing (together with an orderly diet) it helps to make the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Child, to be more ſound, and healthful. For if the blood and humours, wherewith the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo</hi> is nouriſhed, be tainted with impurities, and diſtempers, may eaſily thereby lay the foundation of a weak conſtitution; and make the Child prove ſickly, and diſeaſed, and all for want of help; in curing the Mothers infirmities.</p>
               <p>That theſe pills, and <hi>Cordial Elixir,</hi> are ſafe and harmleſs, in this caſe; yea and ſtronger Medicines than they (not to ſay vomits themſelves, which I have ſometimes ordered to women in that condition and that with good ſucceſs) is evident; Firſt from the mildeneſs of the vegetable Ingredients (having not a grain of a Mineral in it) and next from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental good effects thereof: ſo that if women at length would admit of taking ſome thing for their own, and Childs good, they might live more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, and cheerfully, during that time, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they do.</p>
               <p>Alſo theſe Pills, and <hi>Cordial Elixir</hi> are proper for the infirmities of young women, as the <hi>Green-Sickneſs, Aſthmatical Cachexies</hi> and other diſeaſes depending upon the <hi>Aliquid amplius, (viz.)</hi> upon the obſtructions of the <hi>Menſes:</hi> For thoſe obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:41152:193"/>are (originally) from a rejected <hi>Sordes</hi> of the blood, which furs up the Orifices of the veſſels of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> whereby the blood, being prevented of its natural critical evacuation, flows back, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a <hi>Plethory,</hi> and ſometimes Fevers, and <hi>Stagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Blood in the Lungs, and other parts: whence ſhort-windedneſs, ſtuffing, and ſtopping of the Stomach, want of appetite, indiſpoſition to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with other Symptoms, pains, ſwellings, and the like, which are the ſequels of this obſtruction of the uterine veſſels. Towards the correcting of which Enormities, theſe <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pills, and <hi>Cordial Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir</hi> avail much; For the eſſential Salts, wherewith theſe preparations are impregnated, are aperient of the veſſels: and with the other Ingredients, are abſterſive with all, thereby anſwering the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of theſe diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> or ſweating Pills, their uſe is of pretty large extent, as an auxiliary to the other two: and that chiefly, in all Fevers, whether continued, or intermittent, in all colds, and coughs, (which require (to the cure thereof) ſweatings, and breathings, of the blood) alſo in all Colicks Looſeneſſes, Vomittings, bloody Fluxes, Defluxions of Rheume, Head-aches, and generally of moſt pains, to which they certainly give eaſe; eſpecially if they are taken after an opening of the body by the <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pills, for ſo taken, they frequently give eaſe in the greateſt torments, and gripings, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſtay violent vomitings, and purgings, by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the inragements of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or regent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Stomach; and putting the <hi>Pylorus</hi> in good order, makes it obſerve the due ſeaſons of its open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhutting.</p>
               <p>Now as to the directions for the manner of uſe
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:41152:193"/>of theſe three Medicines take as followeth: and firſt, as to the <hi>Scorbutick</hi> or <hi>Cathartick</hi> Pills, the <hi>Doſe</hi> is from one, to four, or five, but two or three is the common ordinary <hi>Doſe,</hi> ſwallowing them down, in a ſpoonful or two of Poſſet-drink, or any other liquor, alwaies beginning with a leſs number, as one, or two; and as they work, ſo accordingly to keep to that number, or to take more, to four or five, according as the body is more difficult to work on, or the diſeaſe more radicated. If you take but one, that may be done over night, laſt to bed-ward, which will give one ſtool, or perhaps two, the morning following: if you do ſo, you may go about your occaſions the day following: But if you take two or three, then you are to take them betime in the morning, in bed, or up: if you take them in bed, you may lye two, or three hours after: and when you get up, take one draught of hot Poſſet-drink, which let commonly be three hours after the taking of them, and ſometimes to take nothing after them till noon, and then take a porringer of broth, and eat a little warm meat, airing the drink at dinner, and for that day, (if it be cold) not to ſtir abroad. They may be taken two daies together, and reſt the third; or may be taken every other day, or every third, fourth, or fifth day, or once a week, as the neceſſity of the diſeaſe requires, and opportunity gives leave. For diſeaſes of long continuance, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire frequent takings thereof: while you take them, eat but ſparingly, but eſpecially at Suppers. You may with ſafety take often of them, for they do not work, by any fretting corroſion of the Liquids and Solids of the body, but by gentle reminding the digeſtions, of their due ſeparations; and by their Balſamick Ingredients, make the patient more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:41152:194"/>and lively, by adding vigour to the ferment of the ſtomach: and that in all the Diſeaſes aforeſaid. They may be taken at any Seaſon of the Year.</p>
               <p>Secondly. As to the Cordial <hi>Elixir,</hi> the doſe is from a thimblefull to a ſpoonful; and that either ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alone, to thoſe who can ſo take it, putting a piece of Sugar or Sugar-Candy into their mouths, which diſſolving, takes away the bitterneſs, and heat of the mouth and <hi>Larynx,</hi> which the <hi>Elixir</hi> taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, leaves behind it; or elſe thoſe who cannot take it ſo, are to take it in a glaſs of Sack or White-Wine: but the other way of taking it alone is the better, for though it be more bitter and hot, while it is going down, yet as ſoon as it comes into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, it becomes grateful, and thereupon accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereto, doing its work more really, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a more effectual Cordial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for diſcuſſing Wind and Diſeaſes thereon depending. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is to Faſt two or three hours after the taking thereof, and to take it thoſe mornings they take not the <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pills; and ſometimes (as afore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected) to take thereof, about three or four by the Clock in the afternoon, of that day the Pills are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or at going to bed, according to former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and that in all the Diſeaſes afore named.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, As to the <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> or Sweating Pills, The <hi>Doſe</hi> thereof, is one, two, or three Pills, but two is the ordinary <hi>Doſe,</hi> which are to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down in a ſpoonful of Burnt-Wine, Mace-Ale or Poſſet-drink, taking a draught of the ſame hot-drink after them: But thoſe who cannot ſwallow them as Pills, may diſſolve them in any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Liquors, and waſh it down with a little of the ſame clear drink. Theſe are to be taken laſt at night, at bed-time, which, without laying many more
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:41152:194"/>cloths than ordinary, will bring the Patient into a pleaſant, gentle, breathing Sweat, more than any other Medicine I ever yet met with, and will allay the greateſt thirſt, and bring the Patient into a deſired calmneſs and quietneſs of Spirits, abating the moſt rigorous <hi>Symptoms</hi> of moſt Diſeaſes, whether <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi> or <hi>Chronical.</hi> The next morning after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Sweating Pills, the Patient is to take, either a <hi>Doſe</hi> of the Cordial <hi>Elixir,</hi> with a glaſs of Burnt-Wine, or a draught of other hot drink after it; or only ſo much clear Burnt-Wine, Mace-Ale or Poſſet-drink, while he is in bed, and to lie two or three hours after; which will bring the Patient again into an eaſie breathing Sweat; which (if he pleaſe) he may help forward, with the addition of one Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than ordinary. But theſe are generally to be taken after a gentle evacuation by the <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Pills, in <hi>Chronick</hi> Diſeaſes; or by them, or Clyſters in Fevers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly. To number the varieties of Cures, that have, by the Bleſſing of God, been performed by the help of this <hi>Ternary</hi> of Medicines, would but prove tedious, and therefore I ſhall purpoſely wave it.</p>

Then I placed the water in great glaſſes, upon a ſand-Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, with a gentle heat, and in a days time a thin cruſt or film ſwom upon the top thereof, which I took off with a ſilver ſpoon, and dryed it in the

This I took, and diſſolv'd it in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſtill'd Rain-water, and filtred it; which left an other inſipid, gritty powder, with a ſparkling luſtre. The clear filtred water (which with Oyl of Tartar poured thereto, I found, gave a milky ſeparation, as if taken freſh from the Spring, but with Gauls it gave no purple Tincture, after the precipitation of the red earth, but became pale-coloured thereby) This filtred water (I ſay) being again evaporated to a dryneſs, was diſſolv'd, filtred, and evaporated again, and ſo a third time, ſeparating ſtill, what would be ſeparated, by frequent filtration.</p>
               <p>Of the foreſaid quantity of <hi>Spaw</hi>-water, I took about two quarts; which having filtred, I put it in a skillet, and boiled away two thirds; then I let it cool, and a ſediment of an inſipid <hi>Calx</hi> fell to the bottom, from which I filtred the water, dryed up the <hi>Calx;</hi> and then boyled up the water to the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Salt, which was pretty white. This I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in ſimple diſtill'd Rain-water, and then filtred, and the <hi>Calx</hi> being dryed in the Sun, was a bright ſparkling powder: The filtred water I evaporated in glaſſes with a gentle heat, to almoſt a dryneſs, then I filtred it again, and ſo on.</p>

All theſe Earths or <hi>Sabulums</hi> were equally dryed in the Sun, or a gentle heat <hi>Analogous</hi> thereto; and therefore could not have different colours from different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heat; none of them underwent any <hi>Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> or ſtreſs of fire, nor received any alterations from any additionals (being ſimply done, without mixture, ſave of diſtill'd Rain-water) all theſe <hi>ſabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> ſeparations were inſipid; for the Salt, where the taſte was, became concentred in a ſmall room.</p>
               <p>Now if the water be drunke, while theſe ſtony concretions are in it, as it is in all that is drunke at the Spring, or elſewhere; if any harm (I ſay) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to any Patients that drink of it, for want of other good Medicines to carry away the feculent dregs thereof, it is chiefly from theſe <hi>ſabulous</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, which precipitate upon the bowels, ſides, and <hi>Orifices</hi> of the Veſſels, which preventing, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the wonted fluidneſs of the blood and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate juyces, occaſionally in ſome bodies (apt thereto) may cauſe Fevers, Dropſies, Defluxions of Rheume, and the like; It may alſo increaſe the <hi>Sabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Duelech,</hi> and thereby become improper for thoſe afflicted with the Stone. For the Spirit of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine (that <hi>Calculorum Architeccus</hi>) meeting with theſe Earths or <hi>Sabulous</hi> Concretions, becomes coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated thereon (in bodies prone thereto) and by its <hi>petrefying Coagulation</hi> gives beginning (at leaſt) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:41152:197"/>the <hi>Duelech.</hi> The ſame <hi>Sabulums</hi> may alſo contribute to the Torments, or Gripings of the Guts, by clinging to the Tunicles thereof; and further may vitiate the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the Membranous parts of the veſſels, and thereby may ſuffer the (otherwiſe <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>) <hi>Latex</hi> to <hi>ſtagnate</hi> in the veſſels; and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſwellings in the belly, legs, or elſewhere, as ſome, after returning from the <hi>Spaws,</hi> find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves troubled with.</p>
               <p>For we are to conſider, That the ſeveral Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons firſt have a concomitant heat, by which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be inclin'd to a <hi>ſabulous Precipitation</hi> upon the bowels themſelves, unleſs it be carried off by ſome other good <hi>Abſterſives</hi> (which ought of right to be given upon the drinking of the Waters) and next to that we are alſo to conſider, the <hi>Anaſtom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſis</hi> of the veſſels, each into other, in the whole circuit of the body, to be as ſo many Colanders, Streiners or Filters, by which the recremental <hi>Sabulum</hi> may (ſuppoſe) as to the courſer part, be left upon ſome of the bowels; and the finer part, by cloſer Colan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, may be left upon other more remote veſſels, and in both cauſe obſtructions, ſufficient ſometimes to procure trouble enough.</p>
               <p>Not unlike to theſe ſtony Concretions, is the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareous</hi> Sediments of our meat and drink; and though <hi>Helmont</hi> laughs at <hi>Paracelſus</hi> for his bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a <hi>Cleſſis</hi> of <hi>Tartareous</hi> Diſeaſes: yet after that, rectifying the Notion, tells us, That there may be a <hi>Tartarum reſolutum in primâ vel materiâ ultimâ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtens.</hi> I ſay, the better Kitching-Preparations and Fermentations our meat and drink undergo, and the ſtronger the fermental Digeſtions are, the leſs of a Tartar, or rejected Sediment, is thrown upon the parts; and conſequently, the more raw our meat and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:41152:197"/>drink is taken, and the weaker the ferment of the ſtomach is, not throughly volatizing the nutritive Juyce, the more of this <hi>tartareous</hi> Sediment is, by the Streiners and Filters of the ſeveral parts of the body, left behind, which encreaſeth the <hi>Duelech,</hi> gives beginning to Obſtructions, Dropſies, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from what ſtones theſe <hi>Sabulous Ramenta</hi> are, I know not, and at preſent have not a <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope</hi> by me, to make Obſervation of the various ſhapes thereof; and though Maſons tell us, That the ſame ſtone differently cut, nay, though with the ſame Tools, doth by various reflections, give ſeveral, and ſomewhat diſtinguiſhable colours: yet here the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only (as we may ſuppoſe) running over, or along the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of a <hi>Quarry,</hi> or other Stones, cannot penetrate into the inward parts thereof, and ſo cannot make ſeveral colours from one ſtone. Therefore it's more probable, That theſe Concretions are from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtones, ſands, or earths. And if it were water tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into earth, according to the Experiment of an ingenious Friend of mine, communicated to that great Naturaliſt, Squire <hi>Boyl,</hi> it would retain muchwhat the ſame colour and figuration of parts, but here the parts ſeparated, ſeem to the unaſſiſted eye, to be very diſſimular, ſome gritty and hard, others ſoft and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable, ſome bright and glittering, as if from <hi>Talke,</hi> ſcales of <hi>Venice</hi>-glaſs, or other bright Mineral ſtones, and others are more dull.</p>
               <p>The laſt of theſe ſtony Concretions, which was ſeparated, and which one would have expected to have been the moſt ſubtile and impalpable powder, I found to conſiſt of larger ſiz'd particles, and thoſe bright and ſparkling, as if they had been razings of Cryſtals: And that theſe ſhould lie <hi>dormant,</hi> and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:41152:198"/>inconſpicuous in the water, after ſo many previous ſeparations of powders much more impalpable than it ſelf, gives cauſe to ſuſpect that there is a variety of pores in the body of water, and thoſe two of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſizes and <hi>angularities,</hi> wherein <hi>ſabulous</hi> Bodies and Salts of various ſhapes, may lie undiſcovered to the bare eye, in the texture of water. Therefore if <hi>Microſcopes</hi> were ſo contriv'd, as to take a view of Liquors, we might diſcover many conſiderable things, pertinent to the ſolving diverſe Philoſophical <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena's,</hi> whereof we are yet ignorant.</p>
               <p>Now as to that which remains, after all theſe <hi>ſabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> ſeparations, I mean the <hi>eſurine</hi> Salt, which I call the Eſſence of <hi>Scarborough-Spaw,</hi> is a kind of <hi>alumino-nitrous</hi> Salt, or <hi>Sal Hermeticum;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where you meet in our <hi>Hydrological</hi> Diſcourſe, with the word <hi>[Aluminous Salt]</hi> you are to read it, <hi>Alumino-nitrous Salt,</hi> or <hi>Nitro-hermetical Salt.</hi> This Salt, if duly ordered, is Cryſtalline, ſhoots into long <hi>Stiria's,</hi> and brancheth it ſelf forth in curious ſhapes, upon the bottom of the glaſs, which I cauſe to be cryſtaliz'd in <hi>Balneo Mariae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its taſte is more diſcernably nitrous than otherwiſe, yet is a ſuch a ſort of a <hi>Nitro-hermetical</hi> Salt, as being exactly dryed, and caſt upon hot coals or a glowing <hi>Spatula,</hi> takes no flame; nor doth it melt, nor boyl in a <hi>Crucible,</hi> as that Nitre Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi> ſpeaks of doth: for he means the common Nitre, to be had in Shops (<hi>viz.</hi> Such as is added to Cerots and Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as his own words teſtifie.) Now this <hi>Hermeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Salt in the <hi>Spaw,</hi> flows not in a <hi>Crucible,</hi> in a ſtrong fire, but keeps in a dry white body, and loſeth ſome of its taſte by the force of fire. Therefore what we have ſaid againſt Nitre, in our foregoing Diſcourſe, is to be underſtood the common inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:41152:198"/>Nitre, which is vulgarly uſed. And it's very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that there may be a Magnetical earth, not far from the breaking forth of this Spring, upon which, the Aereal Nitre (whether in the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> upon the ſurface, or in Caverns of the earth) doth centre it ſelf, which joyning iſſue with a Mineral aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, may become a competent cauſe, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of all Mineral Springs: For (to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) there are ſome Bodies to be found in the World, that are truly Magnetical of the Univerſal Spirit, or <hi>Nitro-hermetical</hi> Salt, which flotes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe indiſcernably in the Air; which very thing, rightly underſtood, is no ſmall Key to the <hi>Hermetick</hi> Philoſophy, which I ſhall, at preſent, purpoſely wave further to diſcourſe upon.</p>
               <p>Now the Proportion of this Nitrous Salt, to the whole bulk of the water, after the ſeparation of all theſe ſtony Concretions, is no leſs (according to my compute) than as one is to one hundred twenty eight: ſo that it is at leaſt but the one hundred twenty eighth part of the whole. This pure Salt (which as to taſte is ſomewhat bitter) diſſolv'd, is that I call the Eſſence of the <hi>Scarborough-Spaw;</hi> a little of which, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a glaſs of White or Rheniſh Wine, or in a glaſs of ſimple Spring-water, will (as I have tryed) purge gently by Stool: and without doubt is that, by whoſe efficacy, whatever the <hi>Spaw</hi>-water drunk alone effects, is performed, and that too with a triple advantage.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that the <hi>ſabulous</hi> Concretions are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Art (which ſometimes precipitating other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (as I ſaid before) upon the bowels, may do harm.) And ſecondly, the ſmallneſs of its quantity prevents that hazard to ſome bodies, which the gulping down great draughts of water may produce. For ſuch
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:41152:199"/>large quantities of <hi>Spaw</hi>-water, as are uſually drunk, doth in ſome Conſtitutions too much dilute the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, debilitate the Digeſtions, and vitiate the tone of the Membranous parts, both of the ſtomach and other bowels, and ſo cauſe Fevers, Dropſies, deflux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of Rheume, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, The fitneſs of it to be taken at any Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Year, whether Winter, Spring, Summer, or Autumn; whereas the waters from the <hi>Spaw</hi> it ſelf, are only to be drunk in the Summer-Seaſon. But this Eſſence may not only be drunk then, which at that time of the year, may be taken in three, four or five glaſſes of any good ſimple Spring-water; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe who cannot come to the <hi>Spaws:</hi> but alſo may conveniently enough be taken in the Winter, and in the Spring (when the <hi>Spaw</hi>-water it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with efficacy be drunk, becauſe too much diluted with Rain or Snow-water) in a glaſs of White or Rheniſh-Wine, as I ſaid; which though it be taken in ſuch a proportion, as not to work ſenſibly by ſtool, yet will it have a ſafe and innocent, though an inſenſible, Operation.</p>
               <p>Yea, What Diſeaſes the <hi>Spaw</hi>-water is found pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for, being taken from the Fountain, for the ſame the Eſſence thereof is alſo as proper, and according to all reaſon moſt effectual, as in the Scurvy, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butical. <hi>Aſthma's,</hi> Dropſie, <hi>Hypocondriack</hi> Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, Fevers, Obſtructions of the Veſſels in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Diſeaſes thence depending, together with ſeveral other Diſtempers, as may be further ſeen in the Diſcourſe it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Eſſence of the <hi>Spaw</hi> hath this priviledge in the Cure (at leaſt in the aſſiſtance of the Cure) of Fevers, above that of the whole body of the <hi>Spaw</hi>-water, <hi>viz.</hi> That it may be adminiſtred in a glaſs of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:41152:199"/>Wine, and ſo may readily be carried to abſterſe the veſſels of the blood, and other ſpurious fermenting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, from their <hi>Heterogeneities</hi> and <hi>recremental Tartar;</hi> which, if taken in the whole bulk of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, would be prejudicial and dangerous on all hands, as hazarding too ſudden a ſtop to the Fermentation, and thereby occaſion a prepoſterous ſtifling of the volatile Spirits, before they can work themſelves into a new ſtate, by ſeparating <hi>Heterogene</hi> parts, which they conſtantly attempt in moſt Fevers.</p>
               <p>Alſo if this <hi>Spaw</hi>-water contribute (as it's highly extoll'd to that purpoſe) to the making Women fruitful (by removing Obſtructions of the Womb, the frequent concurring cauſe of Barrenneſs) it doth it (I ſay) by virtue of this <hi>Nitro-hermetick</hi> Salt, <hi>viz.</hi> That which I call the Eſſence of the <hi>Spaw;</hi> which indeed, is muchwhat of the ſame nature with that Salt which fructifies all Plants and Fruits of the Earth, makes all Soyls multiply in great plenty, and may give probability of fruitfulneſs to Women, by opening thoſe Obſtructions which frequently hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conception.</p>
               <p>By the help of this concentred Eſſence, every ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Current-Spring may be made a <hi>Spaw,</hi> by diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a competent quantity hereof, in four, five, ſix or ſeven glaſſes of any Spring-water in the Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, which may alſo not a little increaſe its purgative quality, in as much as the <hi>Spaw</hi>-waters often Purge downward by their very weight, witneſs the <hi>Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oline-Spaw</hi> at <hi>Knarsborough,</hi> which rarely purgeth any other way, than downwards by its very weight, either by Stool or Urine. So that this very Eſſence, might very properly be taken in the ſame Sweet <hi>Spaw,</hi> at the Seaſon of the Year; and ſo you might have the virtue of both <hi>Spaws</hi> in one, which would
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:41152:200"/>probably thereby anſwer more general <hi>Indications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, By the help of our aforeſaid <hi>Ternary of Medicines,</hi> together with ſome other good <hi>Specificks,</hi> joyning iſſue (at the Seaſon of the Year) with the uſe of the <hi>Scarborough-Spaw</hi>-water, might effect very conſiderable Cures in moſt Chronick Diſeaſes; or the ſame, with the Eſſence of the ſame <hi>Spaw,</hi> to be taken in the Winter, Spring, or any other Seaſon of the Year, might not improbably effect the like Cures.</p>

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:41152:201"/>that he took forth of his Belly was near two Gallons, the Liver was ſound and good as any could be, ſo likewiſe his Heart; but the Spleen was diſcoloured and vitiated, the <hi>Omentum</hi> was black, rotten and foetid. Some of this Liquor he caus'd to be plac'd over a fire, to evaporate ſome of the moiſture; the remaining part thicken'd; and was as ſtiff as a gelly, and that of a very green colour. It was of ſo ſtiff a conſiſtence as that a ſpoon might have ſtood in it. Which Experiment evinceth the truth of theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Liver is innocent in the <hi>geneſis</hi> of Dropſies, <hi>In Hydrope inſons eſt hepar,</hi> ſaith <hi>Helmont;</hi> and therefore all Medicines that are directed in the <hi>Galenical</hi> road, to the opening Obſtructions in the Liver, or to any other Indication thereof, in order to the Cure of Dropſies, is ſhot at random, yea quite by the mark: and ſo to be rejected as frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Spleen is a part ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Fabrick of Dropſies (to which I may without doubt add the Stomach) the Blood doth not undergo thoſe wonted Circulations or Cohobations upon its own fixt body or <hi>Caput mort</hi> in the Spleen; and ſo conſequently doth not receive thoſe due Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, nor is inrich'd with the indowments of that noble Ferment, which doth not a little contribute to the <hi>Eucraſia</hi> of the Blood: Hence the Blood in part becomes too much diluted and wateriſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That that, which completes the wateriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Blood is Obſtructions of the Reins, which has a double indication; and that is, firſt the ſmall quantity of Urine that Dropſical Perſons make, and next, the reſtagnation of a great quantity of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected <hi>Latex</hi> into the <hi>Abdomon,</hi> which actually ſwells the Belly.</p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:41152:201"/>
               <p>Fourthly, That in tract of Time, when this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnating <hi>Serum</hi> begins to putrefie (as it will in no long time do, both becauſe it is extravaſated, as alſo becauſe it wants a volatizing and embalming Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) it corrupts alſo and periſheth the <hi>Omentum,</hi> turns it black and foetid; then the whole Maſs falls upon the Bowels, ſpoyls their Tone, and brings Death. Hence the Rot in Sheep, is nothing elſe but, if I may ſo call it, a Dropſical <hi>Aſcites,</hi> from a reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating <hi>Latex,</hi> which by moiſtneſs of wateriſh Ground, or continuance of wet Weather, putrefies and corrupts the <hi>Kell</hi> and ſo other Bowels, thence Death. For in continuance of time it Rots the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Bowels of the Body.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That if this reſtagnating <hi>Serum</hi> have continued ſo long without a genuine reduction, or at leaſt a ſeparation by the proper Conduits, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters,</hi> Pores, <hi>Siedge, &amp;c.</hi> as to begin to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a putridneſs, by whoſe <hi>foetid ſulphureous</hi> Odour, or corroſive Saltneſs, the <hi>Omentum</hi> becomes corrupt and mortified; that then all hopes of Cure is over, becauſe of the periſhing of the Bowels, by the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytical</hi> putridneſs of the Spurious <hi>Latex,</hi> which ſuffering all the thin parts to be evaporated by the natural heat of the adjacent parts, retains only a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Sulphur and Salt, which by a retrograde <hi>Analyſis</hi> corrupts the Bowels, hinders the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, perverts the tone of all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous parts, and in the concluſion ſtifles all the Spirits, both Vital and Animal, whence Death. But if this be taken before the corruption of the <hi>Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or any other Bowels, it may then more readily be cured, I mean ſent away by paſſages and chanels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted as proper <hi>Emunctories</hi> for that purpoſe.
